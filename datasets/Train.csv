This area was always congested. In fact the move to the current location (from the previous location closer to Front Street) was to reduce the congestion going Northbound on Bay and Southbound on Yonge and have quicker access to the highways.

"This article is not accurate.  I live and travel (walk, motorcycle, bicycle, drive)  along the entire new Bloor bike lane installation in High Park-Islington area, that the article cites.  I was at the Etobicoke planning meeting (all 3 hrs).  
1) Data for usage has no prior metrics to calculate usage , therefore they are pulling increase ridership out of their asses.  I was there since the 1st night the lanes were put in place.  There is NO increased ridership, even on sunny, clear holidays. I have photography (dated) at morning and afternoon rush hours, showing the lanes empty for 1/2 hr at a time. 

At the meeting, a gentleman showed a 24hr time-lapsed video that showed 8 (EIGHT!) cyclists over a 24 hr period.
My anecdotal evidence of walking the Bloor West strip  daily, at a variety of times, is that the Uber Eats cyclists make up a large percentage of usage.

2) Emergency response time is increased dramatically- myself, and all of my neighbours, agree that they regularly see emergency response vehicles TRAPPED in the single lane of traffic on Bloor.

At the Etobicoke meeting, this past spring, the fire station chief attended to say that their station was opposed to the bike lane since his trucks are stuck regularly and his response time has increased much higher than the previously and vs. the city avg.
The article says that it has increased by 42 seconds. How is this not a huge concern, if you are having g a heart attack or risk of fire??? The article dismisses this as a false claim??

The city’s OWN data states that bicycles account for 0.003% of overall road usage (cars, buses, delivery vehicles, construction, bicycles).
It is insane to remove 50% of the road, shared by TTC and emergency vehicles, for a seasonal and tiny percentage of usage.  Even if ridership increased 1000%, that’s 3% at most.
No body is opposed to bicycle lanes- just move them to dedicated, and safer, secondary routes.  Why is this concept so difficult to understand?? It seems like a narcissistic mentality to ignore these facts.",Toronto
"It’s not the bike lanes causing congestion, it’s the road construction. It’s everywhere you turn. Drive from one side of the city to another and it is impossible to not be bottle-necked/affected by construction congestion. 

By the way, if the city wants to save some money, how about they don’t rip up perfectly good sections of roads to pave over them a week later. Said this about sidewalks a couple of years ago too. There are so many sections of streets that I drive on every day, were completely fine but are currently being ripped up just to be paved over again. 

Now that condo construction companies aren’t making as much money, Doug Ford must be turning to the road construction industry for his next five years of kick-backs. How much will they make if they revert all these bike lanes bake to car lanes?",Toronto

\* a small note that in 2012, the allotted development fees do not nearly cover the hard cost associated with development. Development was slargely being subsidized by the existing tax base.  
At 2012 prices, trippling of fees would have been required to cover development costs with a minor surplus 10% which could have gone towards city-wide capital expenditures like WTP.

In 2013 Between 2013 , the City of Toronto only had 360 M in reserve development fees. By 2019 - 6 years later, it had amassed $839 million to reach $1.2 billion. For the entire city, to fund parks, community centres, libraries ect for the *thousands of people added within an area*.

999% increase in fees looks terrible until you realize that *up until 2015*, Toronto Tax payers were padding out development costs for Daniels, Centrecourt, Tridel, Diamond etc and they still built investment units and they still complained about fees.  And when City was finally catching up, the pandemic hit.

If you think a 2B reserve is a lot of money,  its not. And BILD crying Toronto is sitting on money is because you dont churn out a library or a park in a week, you cant start any significant design phase until funding is secured, so it will be years out until the money earmarked for the park, or facility is spent.

"Summary from Google Gemini:  
  
The video is about the traffic problem in Toronto. The speaker talks about the causes of the problem, the solutions, and the things that people can do to help.

Some of the key points from the video are:

* The traffic in Toronto is terrible and it's getting worse.
* The city is growing rapidly, but the infrastructure hasn't kept up.
* This has led to congestion on the roads, which makes it difficult to get around.
* There are a number of factors that contribute to the traffic problem, including the number of cars, the design of the roads, and the way people drive.
* There are a number of things that can be done to improve the traffic situation in Toronto. These include building more roads, improving public transportation, and encouraging people to drive less.
* However, these solutions will take time and money to implement.
* In the meantime, there are a number of things that people can do to help alleviate the traffic problem. These include avoiding driving during rush hour, carpooling, and using public transportation.
* Ultimately, the traffic problem in Toronto is a complex one that will require a variety of solutions. However, by working together, we can make a difference.",Toronto
"I just don't see the point of building mostly new low-speed track through Peterbrough just to avoid freight traffic.  The old track alignment is quite curvy, through rough terrain, and avoids most population centres.  If we're going to built a third rail link between Toronto and Montreal, why not use it for freight and keep the existing CN tracks through Kingston for passengers.

The existing CN tracks are fairly straight; if it was grade separated and upgraded it could be faster than the Acela in the US.  Most of the curves look to be wide enough for 220 km/h with just a handful of sections where trains would have to slow bellow 200 km/h.  That should be enough to qualify as high-speed by European standards (200 km/h for upgraded lines, 250 km/h for purpose built lines).

Now if we're talking about 300 km/h ""proper"" high-speed rail that a different matter.  Either alignment would need extensive land acquisition for 300 km/h tracks and the empty land along the Peterbrough alignment is probably a lot cheaper.  It also makes more sense for a dedicated express route between Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal to avoid the smaller population centres.",Toronto

"A few excerpts from this overview:

>Among the first serious proposals to shift Toronto traffic underground was 1963’s Plan for Downtown Toronto. Published by the city’s planning board, it examined ways to separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic. One idea was to construct a series of tunnels along major routes to carry traffic through the core. “Leaving the present street surface to the pedestrian and putting vehicular traffic below might be the more desirable, as people should be able to walk into the ground floor of all buildings, particularly shops and offices, and be able to reach public transit easily,” the report observed. While the authors didn’t expect such a system to be in place before 1980, they recommended that any new buildings be constructed to fit multiple below-ground levels for vehicles and public transit. The vision was to create a more attractive, interesting streetscape that could provide a model for similar rethinking elsewhere.
>
>A year after the study was published, Toronto Star writer Val Sears imagined what a stroll down Bay Street would be like if the plan were implemented: “There are no cars or trucks or buses. They are below us in fast-moving vehicle tunnels as wide as the street. We walk amid fountains and trees from perhaps a park where the old City Hall used to be, between tall buildings to a financial plaza at King and Bay.” Escalators would connect to the underground roadways, while parking lots would be equipped with loading and unloading bays.
>
>But downtown never got its traffic-tunnel network. Instead, it would be pedestrians who moved below the surface, thanks to the expansion of the PATH network.
>
>...
>
>As recently as 2015, a consortium proposed a plan to city council that would have seen a tunnel run for 6.5 kilometres between Cherry Street and Jameson Avenue at a cost of $4 billion, with another $1 billion for tunnelling part of Front Street. City staff rejected the idea, indicating it would take more than a decade to conduct environmental assessments and get the necessary permits from the city and province. Experts believed that any spiralling costs would be political suicide. City council’s executive committee indicated that they preferred to stay with an approved rehabilitation project.
>
>Whether the Highway 401 tunnel proposal becomes reality or not, it’s all but certain that, at some point in the future, some developer, politician, or planner will devise yet another underground solution to the city’s traffic issues. Given current circumstances and political animosities, it’s worth considering what Globe and Mail columnist Marcus Gee observed in 2012 about determining the fate of the Gardiner Expressway: “It is impossible, in such a poisoned atmosphere, to make a rational decision.”

* Continuing the implementation of the Housing Action Plan, including advancing Planning studies focused on **removing policy and zoning barriers** to enable the creation of new housing supply.

If there was a car crash or some other kind of accident where people were sent to the hospital, it was always the low man or woman on the totem pole who was sent out to the waiting room to get quotes from the family. Bonus points if they could get it from the injured person in their hospital bed. If the young reporter was ever dismissed by a grieving family or patient in pain, they would be sent back to the hospital with a bouquet of flowers and told to try again. A lot of the time these quotes were never even run in the paper. It was just seen as good practice to toughen up reporters to talk to people who did not want to talk to them.

Second, does anyone remember the murder of [Cecilia Zhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Cecilia_Zhang)? I was a young journalism student who worked on that story for a tiny little community newspaper. The only real thing I did was go to the parents' house back when it was still being viewed as a kidnapping and the public was being asked to call in with tips. Anyway, I watched a Toronto Sun photographer take a 'Have You Seen Cecilia?' poster off a lamp post, step over a police line, and then tape it up inside the phone booth where a call (from the kidnappers? I forget exactly the context) had been made. I was telling this to my photography teacher later, and he made it part of his lecture. The difference between 'photo journalism' and 'photo illustration' is you're not allowed to do what the Sun did to get a picture of the missing girl flyer inside the phone booth where a call relevant to that day's news story was made from. (Also, you shouldn't be going over a police tape for a photo no matter what you're doing, but I guess that was a different lesson.)

There are a lot of things I regret about the decline of newspapers. The decline of the Sun is not one of them.",Toronto
"too bad conservative politicians want to keep pushing the lie that focusing on transit and active transportation is the cause of congestion and if we stopped with these efforts, things would go back to the imagined glory days of our grandfathers where traffic was non-existent and parking right in front of every business was always available and free. The city is growing and with more people comes more demand for transportation and personal vehicles will never be able to sustain that demand. The sooner our politicians and public accept that, the better our cities can respond.",Toronto
"Credit to the conservatives where its due.  They have done alot to ruin the province but this is a good rule.

"The city needs more intelligent traffic lights coupled with red light cameras at every intersection.

The traffic lights have zero communication with each other and often you will get stopped by 4 or more red lights in a row. Often you will get stopped by a side street turning green for no reason. You sit there and no pedestrians or traffic goes through.

Having lights timed better through a connected intranet means everyone wins, including pedestrians and transit vehicles (it does a better job at transit priority), not just cars. It promotes less dangerous driving because when theres no intelligent light system, people gun it to get out of being stuck at yet another red light. It's also better for the environment.

It actually promotes going the speed limit because if done properly, going exactly the speed limit will decrease your chances of hitting a red as they are timed to change green once a car going the speed limit arrives to the intersection. Speed and you just hit another red.

Pay for it with the red light runners fines from the cameras.",Toronto

"Gather round, young 'uns, and I'll tell you a tale.

[Back in the olden days, the booze at the LCBO was kept behind the counter](https://macleans.ca/facebook-instant-articles/why-cant-ontarians-buy-booze-in-corner-stores-blame-the-surveillance-state/). You couldn't browse the shelves.

For many years after the end of prohibition - up until 1957 - you had to carry an *alcohol permit book*. The book got a new entry every time you purchased alcohol, and logged every bottle of booze you bought. It also contained an information section, which reported your address, age, employment, and marital status to the LCBO's clerks.

The LCBO would monitor your alcohol purchases, look at them (with prejudice, racism, and arbitrary judgement) in the context of your socioeconomic position and ethnicity, and determine whether or not you ought to be allowed to buy alcohol, or how much.

The LCBO also maintained the Interdiction List (known almost universally as the ""Indian List""): individuals and whole classes of people who were ineligible to purchase alcohol. This included all aboriginal peoples (hence the name) plus anyone else the government thought should be barred.

After the permits (and a subsequent short-lived card system with similar aims and methods) were retired, the alcohol remained behind the counter at the LCBO. You filled out a request card, presented it to the clerk, and they brought you your booze. (Those who remember the 1980s will remember this model from Consumers Distributing stores.)

The first self-serve LCBO store opened in 1969, so the Toronto store pictured above would be one of a dying breed. The Indian List, meanwhile, was finally abolished around 1975.",Toronto

"I've scanned through the comments here and it is apparent that most unfortunately do not understand the Canadian Youth Criminal Justice act.

At 13 you cannot be sentenced to life nor can you be tried as an adult. The maximum youth sentence at 13 is 3 years but with the youth Criminal Justice Act judges are compelled to assign the least restrictive sentence possible.

So given that, the youth spent 15 months in pre trial custody and this had historically been credited as double time.

So on paper she served 15 months at double credit for time served giving her 30 months or a year and 6 months 

Given the max sentence is 3 years and the judge has to assign the least restrictive sentencing, given her on paper time of 30 months this judge was just following the letter of the law.

The reason is because of the growing evidence that children up to and even including the age of 21 do not have the same reasoning levels or accountability for their actions so a 13 year old doesn't have the capacity of reason, right vs wrong, accountability etc as an adult as their brains are still forming

So many will be angered by this sentence but there is a reason why it happens. The science is that long Term incarceration has a significantly detrimental effect on the minds of kids 

They can't process punishment like adults, locking them away actually creates more problems in a developing brain and potentially produces life time criminals.

Don't shoot the messenger, that's just a summary of why the judge sentenced as they did.",Toronto

**Policies like this are based on pure spite and culture war, not reason.** It doesn’t matter that bike lanes don’t actually cause congestion, it doesn’t matter that “one more lane bro” will not fix traffic, and it doesn’t even matter that Toronto has repeatedly studied its few separated bike lanes and proven over and over again that they get well used and make local businesses better off.

All he cares about is that when he’s driving from his suburban house to the legislature downtown every day, the bike lanes and streetcars are in his way.

Notice he doesn’t reference any actual statistics of use whatsoever. He just says that _he personally_ doesn’t see them (how often is he actually looking?), makes up numbers, and says some business owners whined about it.

Old buildings will likely not have enough infrastructure for more efficient space use (overly thick walls, small pipes that will not make dish washers and in-suite laundry).

She'll probably promise federal funding for the feasibility studies if the liberals stay in power, basically a bribe to keep the federal ridings in the 905 and 416 as liberal.

If Poilivere is elected, the feasibility studies shows it can be build at a cost of $900 billion, and Ford appeals for federal funding most likely it will be rejected as ridiculous, the outgoing libs can go on and claim that the federal Conservatives don't care to invest in Ontario.

I have my doubts Ford will be re elected premier in the Ontario 2026 Provincial election if Poilivere is elected PM in the 2025 Federal Election or earlier.

Expect Ford to turn into ""Doug the Builder"" and propose more bizarre building projects as he tries to appeal to voters.",Toronto

But he is required to pay above market wages and HRDC reassesses the local wages levels every 3-6 months and notifies the employers…and he is supposed to be proving he paid them higher wages by filing copies of payroll records for CPP/EI/tax withholdings that he sent to Canada Revenue. 

And they did have to pay some 3rd party scam artist to get their permits…10K each except that is illegal. Employer is supposed to pay for flights, permits, any immigration consulting, advice. That “consultant” will lose her license and have to pay a huge fine, go on a list of banned consultants. Potential jail time but more likely fines.

They were completely dependent on consultants during the design phase of Crosstown and Finch West. During the construction phase Metrolinx became reliant on TTC for technical knowledge and to assure the contractors did the work right.

Both Crosslinx and Mosaic group are suing Metrolinx for this reason. They signed a contract with the Crown and they expect Metrolinx to be the representative of the Crown. TTC is an outsider third party which does not have a role in the contract between the companies and Metrolinx.

"Happened to have stayed in both cities. I’d never  be jealous of Chengdu at this perspective. 

Chengdu’s subway system, similar to many other cities in China, has been at a rapid rate of expansion. But it’s management is awful, and Toronto has no where to compare with in this. No emergency plans, compulsory security check with opening ur bags, etc. 

Take Zhengzhou, another major city in China, as an example. It’s subway system was completely vulnerable. In 2021, the rain in Zhengzhou city has caused a flood within its urban area and those rain water flooded inside its subway station and tunnels (literally flooded where water can reach to the top of the tunnel). And this has caused more than 300 people died in a single day. You still can find videos online from that day: people were recording their last moments of their lives while waiting for water to fill above their head and get drowned to death.

Chengdu’s subway system has expanded to some of the rural areas where those are ACTUALLY villages and no one was using the subway system there. 

The main reason behind Chengdu government’s on expanding its subway system this fast was to buy local residents’ land at a extremely low price and sell those lands at a EXTREMELY high price to the construction companies(either subway construction or residential building construction). 

Thousands and millions of local residents have lost their homes with a minimum compensation and were left devastated and even suicide at the end.",Toronto

I remember it was a big deal to flip through it and see pretty much every section, even the Sports section, affected by the attacks. This was something I'd never seen before. No news event had upended the ""normal"" world in such an extreme way before, and nothing else did until Covid. 

One thing that people who weren't old enough to remember 9/11 might not understand is how much legitimate fear there was: now we know the scope of the attacks, but at the time, none of us had any idea if it was over, or just the first in a series of similar attacks. There was a sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop that went on for days, weeks, months and even years. (In a sense, that did happen with terrible attacks in London and Madrid and other places, though not in North America.)

For me personally 9/11 and Covid feel like significant milestones that aged me: on 9/11 I was in my 20s but still coasting along on a studenty mindset in my first real job; but that day and all the fallout pushed me into what felt like real adulthood and things never quite felt so lighthearted again.

WHF exposes that higher level manager never really contributed much.

Most of their budgets and oversight was all about office supplies and logistical issues (both interpresonal and equipment) related to in-office existence. They existed *because* we were all there. Without us there, they can no longer justify why they deserve to get paid. They are the ones with the power to decide whether we need to come back. So, here we are. We are their job security.

WFH also interferes with the ability of management to take credit for others' work. WFH means email trails and time-stamp meta-data of every edit. WFH exposes that these managers never ever created real work-plans with clear deliverable, nor did they ever properly manage the project or workloads.

"A big part is that folks are angry and they project that frustration / rage onto others. I do that myself if I'm having a bad day - especially if  see cyclists don't stop at stop signs, or dont slow when there are cars / pedestrians immediately in the vicinity. 

Unfortunately those of us 'good cycling citizens' also get the scorn. And bear the brunt of other drivers/pedestrians  being on the receiving end of bad actor, inconsiderate cyclists. This is undeserved but still distressing. 

That's said - the safety of a cyclist with children in tow should always come first, and I wouldn't begrudge you for rolling through a STOP sign, if i were driving, (if that's what happened as you turned right).

Unfortunately.there will always be tension between car drivers and bike riders for as long (not exhaustive):

a) road laws prioritize the individual and not the layout (North American thing) 
b) drivers dont treat cyclists as vulnerable users 
c) cyclists dont learn and abide by the rules of the road

Remember, you still need lanes for emergency vehicles as well, and those shops are a pipe dream. No one will travel to meet in a tunnel, and few cyclists are going to want to stop mid-commute.

"Good. Absolutely ridiculous that they got Canadian funding to begin with but to then screen the propaganda film in a city that has some of the highest concentrations of Ukrainians in the whole country would have been a slap in their faces

For those not in the know, the filmmaker was a frequent collaborator with RT/Russia Today, a known pro-Russia propaganda publication. You can read more [here](https://united24media.com/anti-fake/as-toronto-film-festival-opens-worldwide-backlash-against-trofimovas-russians-at-war-a-documentary-that-sees-no-russian-war-crimes-in-ukraine-grows-2206) but even the conclusion she gives that there are no war crimes being committed should be enough to tell you where the film's bias lies. Ukrainian POWs being r\*ped, surrendering combatants being shot to death and Ukrainian children being captured and relocated into Russia is merely the shortlist of war crimes that have been committed by Russian forces

Edit: it was pointed out to me that technically, the filmmaker doesn't say that no war crimes are being committed by the Russians but rather that she didn't see any taking place. Given the gross amount of evidence to the contrary, it is my belief that she says this as a way to try and downplay the violence from the Russian soldiers.

>Initially launched on Jan.1, the two-year RRL pilot requires landlords renting out four or fewer units in wards one, three, four, five and seven to register with the city for an annual $300 licence.  
>  
>City officials say the pilot protects tenants, but many landlords have been against it since the beginning. Several who have spoken with CBC News say it costs them money, makes them do paperwork and often, their tenants are to blame for the issues flagged by city inspectors.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Since the launch of the pilot, 2,200 landlords have registered for a renting licence while 46 landlords made their illegal units compliant, according to the city.  
>  
>Coun. Rowena Santos, who is also part of the RRL task force, said illegal lodging has led to 8,000 complaints about parking issues in the month of July alone, followed by 1,700 complaints about property standards.  
>  
>Those complaints include fire code violations, unsanitary living conditions, as well as Brampton residents flagging online ads asking female renters for sexual favours in exchange for rooming, she said.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Brown said the city will hire 38 new bylaw enforcement officers in the next two months — some of whom will tackle the numerous complaints related to the RRL pilot.  
>  
>Landlords who register before Sept. 30 will receive a 50 per cent discount on the RRL fees, but starting Oct. 1 applicants will have to pay the full $300, according to the Monday news release.

The idea of licensing landlords can be a helpful one, particularly if there are useful functional standards and enforcement that come along with it. That being said, the current system with the LTB isn't helping with some of the issues identified by the landlords either, and it's clear that it needs to be substantially revamped to meet the needs of both landlords and tenants.",Toronto

"yeah I saw this on the news, so goofy, ""just one more lane will fix it"" if they even looked at a vague estimate of the costs they'll pretend they never brought up this bs, the TYSSE was 8.4km and cost around 3.2 billion, thats like 380mil/km

When they were talking about burying the gardiner, which compared to this would be less operationally complex as you wouldn't need to compete with an active roadway for 10 years of construction, they said it would cost 1.475 billion for what I think was basically the bit at distillery to bathurst being converted to below grade, which is about 3.8km, thats about 390mil/km, so similar

this I'd assume would be, unless they really want to just make a white elephant, be vic park to at least past the airport, say dixie, which is about 30km, 30x.385=11.55 BILLION, at the absolute best, for basically no benefit, close to enough to build two yonge subway extensions, two hurontario LRTs, or a whole other eglinton crosstown

and of course it would cost WAY MORE as the boston ""big dig"" project totalled about 22.5 billion usd, or 30\~ billion CAD, inflation adjusted for a measely 12km route, totaling 2.5 BILLION/KM so if they built it closer to this it would cost a lovely 75 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS, 3/4 OF THAT ""HUGE"" INVESTMENT

Adding tolls to roads is bad. Punishes the poor and adds costs to businesses.

"We almost bought at this building because our friend bought. We were still thinking of buying if one came available. Not anymore.

From what I understand from him. The board is  suing the builder who owns 2 units in the building. And a Tarion claim (who primarily support the builders who pay way more to them then homeowners).

Some woman owner in his building went  door to door to remove the board and kill the lawsuit because she wants to clear the status certificate so she can sell (her and a small group).  They are trying to invalidate the engineering reports (5 or 6), thereby killing lawsuit with builder (these reports are evidence for their case) because there is no guarantee these owners will get money back immediately. So they want to cut bait.

They called the media thinking it would force the board and property management to stop
Everything. But this news story only highlights that engineers will deem the building unsafe unless repairs are done. Her actions have signalled to the public (potential buyers) that the owners will resist fixing the garage. Now CMHC will potentially black list the building for loans because no owners want to pay for repairs or borrow money to pay for them.  She also hired her own lawyer to look after her own interests. The board had a loan so individual special assessments would not be done and owners would lot have to cough up 70K it would be a much smaller amount. But I thjnk that ship sailed. No company will want to deal with this. 

Also, the builder is a lawyer himself and will do his best to slide through this. He could be working behind the scenes to kill the lawsuit which cannot be restarted. These owners shot themselves in the foot and are now telling the entire world their building is deficient and they don’t want to fix it.  No one will want to buy here and if they do, they will be looking to knock off wayyy more than 70k from theist price. 

So if they do nothing and wait for builder to pay, the problem gets worse. The builder may only have to pay for a certain amount and then the price tag goes up and the owners could be in the hook for double that. Because materials and labour aren’t getting cheaper, Way to go! 

Now my friend is screwed because the current board is being removed and being replaced by a board that wants to do nothing and kill the lawsuit and pretend the building is ok despite 5 or 6 engineering reports. Yeah, now the new board/corporation can be sued by individual owners for not doing repairs lol. Let’s add legal fees now. It’s a mess.",Toronto

The city is run on the forced subsidization of downtown offices, restaurants, cafes etc. by forcing millions of commuters against their will to head downtown and back every work day.

Because nobody in their right mind from the suburbs or even from other parts of Toronto would willingly spend their time downtown if they did not have to be there.

Another way in which the free market is not really the free market. Let everyone--who can--work from home and then the free market will allow people the choice of where to spend their time and money.

Ottawa is the same. The downtown runs off the forced subsidization of federal employees.

Interesting thing about a place like Hamilton is that it has a downtown but it has not forced subsidization of bank employees, provincial employees, or federal employees.

There are organizations to counter hate against LGBTQ, Asians (which theoretically includes us but in practice doesn't), First Nations people but not for South Asians.

The requirement for CTO has been reviewed based on existing and future service plans, and operational needs assessment. It has been determined that CTO is not a requirement for day-to-day service for Line 1 and Line 2. There are also technical challenges that arise with CTO on the revenue fleet with one of the main constraints being that the trains on Line 1 are a permanent six car consist with a fixed ATC Train-Borne equipment configuration, whereas the expected new trains for Line 2 will consist of three married pair cars that will be dynamically configured. The dynamic configuration for the Line 2 ATC Train-Borne equipment is not supported by the ATC Line 1 system architecture. It should be noted that to support the CTO feature, additional funding would be required to redesign and upgrade the existing Line 1 ATC system to accommodate CTO. \[Line 2 Modernization Report at pp 16-17\]*""

If he would stop with these idiotic ideas, and stop trying to develop the greenbelt, and instead focus on public transit, making cycling safer/more accessible to all people, and create greater incentive for builders to create affordable housing in and around city centres… it would go a long way to reducing traffic on all of the 400 series highways.

"Cher ami locataire,

Je comprends parfaitement votre frustration face à cette situation complexe. Voici quelques conseils pour vous aider à transformer votre expérience de location et à créer l'environnement que vous méritez :

1. Visualisez votre appartement idéal. Prenez un moment chaque jour pour imaginer votre espace de vie exactement comme vous le souhaitez : une fenêtre qui se ferme parfaitement, un robinet de baignoire fonctionnel, un réfrigérateur silencieux, et une facture d'électricité qui reflète votre consommation réelle.

2. Affirmez vos droits avec confiance. Vous êtes en droit d'exiger un logement en bon état. Continuez à communiquer clairement et calmement avec votre propriétaire, en détaillant par écrit tous les problèmes à résoudre.

3. Cultivez une attitude positive. Même si la situation est frustrante, essayez de rester optimiste. Votre état d'esprit peut influencer la façon dont les autres réagissent à vos demandes.

4. Informez-vous sur vos droits. Renseignez-vous auprès de la Régie du logement du Québec sur vos options si le propriétaire reste inactif. La connaissance est un pouvoir qui vous permettra d'agir avec assurance.

5. Envisagez toutes les possibilités. Si la situation ne s'améliore pas, vous pouvez explorer l'option de résilier votre bail. Cependant, visualisez d'abord une résolution positive où tous les problèmes sont résolus à votre satisfaction.

6. Agissez avec intention. Chaque action que vous entreprenez pour améliorer votre situation, aussi petite soit-elle, est un pas vers la réalisation de votre vision d'un chez-vous confortable et fonctionnel.

Rappelez-vous que vous avez le pouvoir de façonner votre expérience de vie. Restez concentré sur ce que vous voulez accomplir, et non sur ce qui ne va pas. Avec de la persévérance et une attitude positive, vous pouvez surmonter ces obstacles et créer l'environnement de vie que vous désirez.

Gardez confiance en votre capacité à résoudre cette situation. Vous méritez un logement qui répond à vos besoins et respecte vos droits en tant que locataire.",Montreal

My impression of Montreal : 

Montreal is way better than Toronto in every aspect.. but your impression of Montreal depends on many things. To resume.


Montreal if you only speak French = ok

Montreal if you only speak English = a very racist and closed minded  city that tries as much as possible to make you regret moving to Montreal . You hate Montreal so so much.. every single day you wish you return back to anglo-canada! 

Montreal if you speak English and French = awesome place . Best city in Canada by far 


Montreal if you speak English French and third language ..= best city in North America !! Competing with top cities worldwide ( new York. Paris. London etc ) and at a much lower cost go living !!!


I personally DO NOT want Quebec to become another country. But after 3 years here I do understand something...

If it weren't because of the Quebecois... Their fight for the French language etc etc.. Montreal would have become a long long time ago.. another huge mass off buildings and highways with a zombie  population like Toronto !!!  ( Or any other big north american city).


The true soul of Montreal.. is only understood when you are trilingual l english-french+something else. 

 Only then... You understand why Quebec must remain in Canada to give Canada a soul!!  Quebec by itself is nothing. and Canada without Quebec is the temu version of the United States!  But Canada and Quebec together.. wow !!   

Only Montreal .. let's you see the true Canada. Where almost everyone is bilingual.  And 1/3 of the population is trilingual !! That is just wow !! ... Few cities on  the world have the openness of having a growing trilingual population !! 


So to resume.. Montreal kills toronto!! ( But only if you stop being an uni-lingual Anglo ! )

"Je travaille pour une compagnie dont la facture à la PGA (Arena Group qui organise pour PGA) va monter dans les 6 chiffres, proches des 7 chiffres (sans dévoiler le montant)  
Les retombés économiques sont très tangibles pour ce genre d'événement et les gens qui vont voir le golf, comme pour le Tennis d'ailleurs ont tendance à plus dépenser que la F1.  L'investissement ici est minime pour ce que ça va rapporter à des compagnies locales.   
Je touche directement à la grande majorité des événements sportifs et festivals au Québec. F1, Tennis, Osheaga, Jazz, Francos, FEQ, Carnavalde Québec, CF Montréal, Alouettes, Canadiens, Montréal en Lumières, Cirque du Soleil, GP de Valcourt, même Saint-Tite, etc. et la Presidents Cup est de loin l'événement qui va rapporter le plus cette année, et ce, sans déranger le centre-ville.   
Des fois, il faut regarder plus loin que la somme avancée. 9 millions c'est des peanuts ici",Montreal
"Je comprends, c’est chiant en maudit et tout le monde s’en criss, la police inclut même dans le cas d’un délit de fuite. Ça m’est arrivé aussi. J’me suis équipé d’une Dash cam et au moins j’aurai la preuve et le numéro de plaque au complet pour la prochaine fois … une leçon qui va te coûter cher mais en te souhaitant que ça ne t’arrive plus. Bon courage!",Montreal
"The job of a judge is not to make new laws, but to apply the laws that exist to specific situations. If the city of Montreal's bylaws suck that is not the judge's fault, its city council's. That being said the title is deceptive because she never blamed the courts, that seems to be the spin of the original poster.",Montreal
"j’habite à mtl et travaille à laval, je fais tout en transport en commun ou vélo, ma carte opus est plus chère, mais quand même moins qu’une voiture. Souvent le trajet est plus rapide avec les voies réservées et j’ai le temps de lire. Ça arrive que je dois me rendre dans des zones mal desservies, mais overall, y’a plus de + que de -… Y’a des lignes express de bus qui peuvent être interessantes de l’est vers l’ouest, fais tes recherches et tu trouveras un itinéraire qui marche pour toi!",Montreal
"The most legitimate complaints I've heard where about fewer lines going to metro stations with elevators.

It's also really fucking weird that there's no way anymore to go to lionel Groulx or the Atwater market by bus from PSC",Montreal
"Il y a une problème de machisme dans la communauté Maghrébine, loin d'être tout le monde mais assez important pour en parler.

Il y a une vingtaine d'années au Québec il était facile de convaincre l'un de nos camarades de faire une grosse connerie, il suffisait de lui dire qu'il était ""pas game"" et de le traiter de ""tape\*te""...

Le machisme qui existe dans la communauté Maghrébine, combinée à une certaine vision de l'Islam, font en sorte que c'est extrêmement facile de provoquer un jeune en mettant en question sa virilité.

Tu prend un jeune qui veut faire partie de la gang, tu lui dit d'aller voler une voiture et s'il refuse, tu lui dis : ""Je pensais que tu étais un vrai homme"" et tu l'accuse d'avoir peur. Même chose pour une attaque à main armée.

Quand la virilité c'est tout ce qui compte, autant dans la gang, à la maison, à l'école ou dans la religion, bien ça devient extrêmement facile de manipuler un jeune garçon et même un homme.

Et ce n'est pas juste un problème dans la société Maghrébine, ça existe chez les Russes, chez les Mexicains, chez les Albanais et chez plusieurs autres.

Les gangs de rue capitalisent sur la peur des jeunes d'être rejetés, la peur d'être ridiculisé.",Montreal
"What does this actually mean? And what does it mean for La Tulipe specifically?

If it's retroactive, why didn't we do this years ago? If it isn't, what's the city going to do about La Tulipe?!

From everything I've see I really get the feeling this is just going to be an adjustment to noise bylaws in response that one judge's ruling, and that it won't have any meaningful impact.

Would love to be wrong here.",Montreal
"Jesus Christ, people. 

Everyone has to tolerate the normal inconveniences of living in a neighbourhood. 

Nobody has any business thinking they are entitled to absolute, monastery-level silence between the hours of 7 AM and 10 PM. 

Children play. It’s what they do. That causes a bit of noise. Nothing that should bother a normal adult human. 

If it bothers you that much, and it’s not even 10 P.M., then you are the problem. Please just fuck off to the suburbs where you belong. 

If it’s after 10 or 11 P.M., then you’ve maybe got a legit grievance, but otherwise just go ahead and check yourself into a retirement community down in Florida.

OP’s tenant is clearly a dickhead. What kind of person responds to the sound of a small child playing during the day by *blasting* loud fucking music at night??? That’s borderline psycho shit.",Montreal
"La dernière fois que j'ai regardé (2022), c'était autour de 50$/h pour un tuteur avec expérience, peut-être 40$ pour un tuteur qui commence, souvent des étudiants universitaires. C'était en banlieue. Peut-être que c'est un peu plus cher au centre-ville.",Montreal
"Meanwhile I noticed a huge lack of bugs / spiders in my home this year. The only non-spider insects I noticed were a few tiny flies that probably sneak in on bananas. Very few spiders. I'm usually finding spiders every time I do cleaning on the weekends, this year they only started showing up in september as it got colder.

I appreciate there being no bugs around (that I can see) but it's also weird. Haven't even used my fly swatter this year.",Montreal
"La rue Sainte-Catherine du village je l'aimais bien quand je l'ai découvert, mais avec le temps, surtout en passant par là tard le soir, j'ai réalisé à quel point c'est une rue infecte, pleine de junky et de décérébrés, un vrai asile à ciel ouvert. C'est triste, car le village gay devrait être un village classe rempli de tolérance et de bienveillance, mais hélas. D'ailleurs on a volé mon téléphone là-bas mais j'ai pu le récupérer à temps, heureusement.",Montreal
"Y’a un spot comme ça en chemin quand j’apporte mes enfants à l’école en vélo. Littéralement à chaque jour, un camion différent de livraison se stationne “temporairement” là, malgré du stationnement dispo à 10 mètres l’autre côté de la rue. Donc à tous les jours je doit rouler en plein milieu de la rue en sens inverse.",Montreal

* Si quelqu'un t'adresse la parole, un signe de la main et de la tête qui dit ""Oui, je t'ai vu. Non, je veux pas te parler"".

C'est pas compliqué, ne pas parler aux bénévoles. Ils sont là justement à se faire ignorer toute la journée.",Montreal
"Tutoring is good, do it! But also french movies might help. 

I never miss an opportunity to share Quebecois movies, here's my copy paste:

# Simple comme Sylvain (The Nature of Love), 2023

Montreal girl has a country side experience. Second hand embarrassment had me laughing hard and jaw dropping through the entire thing. Great movie. [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJEGwAIcKIY)

# Les Chambres Rouges, 2023

Really good police thriller set in the Palais de Justice then around Montreal. Dark web stuff, very ambiguous character, excellent acting. Not for the faint of heart.

# Laurence anyways, 2012

Actually good trans movie, following an adult couple going through that in Montreal in the \~2000s era. [love this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjQK8GmCKDg&t=56s)

# C.R.A.Z.Y. , 2006

Son of ultra religious family goes through his coming out as a gay man during the \~1960s quiet revolution era in Montreal. Great movie overall. Gives a good sense of this past era. [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Dvh3Xh_9k)

# Mommy, 2014

Deeply personal journey thought a dysfunctional family (single mom / problematic son) in Quebec. Excellent acting. [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X1fB4ylVuk)

# Monsieur Lazhar, 2011

Algerian refugee gets a teaching job in a Montreal public grade school. Both the teacher and the school have experienced trauma. Highlights the struggle of getting uprooted into a foreign society, but also the universality of grief.

# Les Amours imaginaires (Heartbeats), 2010

Plateau people being plateau people. Two ""metropolitan"" Quebecers friends, one gay guy, one girl, start crushing on the ultimate plateau person: a french guy who's overly physical and unaware of it. Excellent, hilarious dialogue and absurdity. [fun scene from the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roLmFo3rWYc)

# Ricardo Trogi movies

Coming of age story following a kid growing up in Quebec. Dad is an Italian immigrant and mom is from country side. Very wholesome. Really liked these movies. The names of the movies are years in the life of the kid:

* 1981 (2009)
* 1987 (2014)
* 1991 (2018)",Montreal
"In Brossard, O Tawouk has really good and generous menu items. I especially like the shawarma on salad. The extras are inexpensive (like, you can add a full bag of pita breads and they're fresher than at the supermarket).",Montreal
Montreal is one of the worst cities in the entire world for parking tickets. I had a single parking ticket I didn't know about and they put a boot on my car. Ticketing practices are predatory and often unfair. Fighting the tickets is extremely difficult and next to Impossible.,Montreal
"Je suis Quebecois et ma copine est française. Au début quand je l'ai rencontré elle ne sortait pas beaucoup de Laval/Montreal et elle detestait le Quebec. Ses parent ont déménager ici donc elle a immigrée ici un peu de force. Elle ce plaigait toujours de tout et ne pensais qu'a partir. Puis quand je l'ai rencontrer je lui ai fait visiter le Québec en dehors de Laval/Montreal, des belles places comme Québec, Tadoussac, le saguenay, gaspé etc.. Depuis on est allez visiter sa famille en france et au retour elle ma dit que la france avais beaucoup changé et qu'elle préférait le QC. J'ai l'impression que souvent les français et ou autres immigrants se plaignent en grosse parti car ils ne sont jamais sorti de Montréal.",Montreal

Ils seront obligés d'apprendre le code de la route, et en plus de ça ils vont cotisé pour les routes que nous les automobilistes, les camionneurs, les motocyclistes, les véhicules d'urgences qui continues à payer pour toute le réseau routier-transport en commun. En plus de nous augmenter notre tarif, il y a toujours des niochants qui ne connaisse pas le code de la route et qui utilise la route tout en pleurant que les autres usagers prennent trop de place. Notre code de la route nous a appris à rester à un mètre de distance d'un cycliste lorsqu'on fait un dépassement. Et vous le cycliste on vous a dis quoi à la saaq de votre responsabilité civile lorsque vous utilisez les routes et mêmes sans casques, le cellulaire en mains et les écouteurs aux oreilles.

I have yet to go to a concert at that venue where I could pay in advance for a seated place (I go to about 20 shows per year - many at the MTelus). Be there in advance.  Good luck!

Edit: This being said, the balcony is large, with many seated places. If you don't care about the front row, being there when the doors open will assure you seats on it.

"Comparing a western city to a eastern city is a bit... it's like apples and oranges. 

Japan has a homeless issue too, but the shame is so severe that they become hikkiomoris instead or hide out in internet cafes for the rest of their lives. There's where the terms NEET originates from.

Saying there's no mental illness in a country with one of the highest suicide rates is a bit ironic 

I'm not saying ""Japan is bad too!"" I frigging love Japan. But there's a huge difference between visiting there as a tourist and actually living there.

Le gouvernement évite de mentionner le PIB/Habitant parce que ça leur fait paraître mal, et les banques évitent d'utiliser le mot récession pour ne pas causer la panique. En vrai, c'est le temps de paniquer. 

On a la pire économie depuis la grande dépression.

Je commençais quasiment à être croyant en allant faire le chemin de croix à l'oratoire et allumer des lampions après mes entrevues.   

Mais cest vraiment une question de chiffre dans ce temps là et quand ça marche pas il faut juste appliquer plus et statistiquement, ça fini par débloquer.   

Quand j'ai commencé à faire de la recherche d'emploi à temps plein, comme si c'était une job en soit, ça finit par débloqué.  

Jai envoyé un tas de CV tout azimut (j'ai abouti à Québec et j'y suis encore).   Je passais mon temps sur indeed et LinkedIn.   J'applique  même en dehors de la province et du pays.   Et quand le chômage a commencé a tirer à sa fin, je me suis fait un petit cv non professionnel pour aller travailler au Tim Hortons du coin (ou whatever) au cas où.   J'en suis pas arrivé là (pas loin) mais au moins j'étais prêt.   J'ai fini par accepté un poste à salaire super bas comparé à avant mais ça m'a permis de pivoter dans ma carrière, j'ai rencontré une fille à Québec et finalement jai eu un enfant avec et j'ai relancé ma carrière a partir de ce petit poste.   En étant paye pas cher, japprenais des skills qu'ils auraient pas montré à un senor bien payé.

Bref, je sais ce que tu vis.   On a comme l'impression d'avoir le contrôle sur rien et on est attente de savoir ce qui se passe quand notre cv passe entre les mains des gens.   Ou ce qu'ils pensent de notre entrevue.

1. Undo the skewer/axle and take off the front wheel and put it to the side of your frame when locking your bike. Keep the skewer with you so the thief would need to ride with a loose wheel.
2. Take off the bike seat (need a quick-release clamp) and keep it with you. 
3. (Extreme nuclear option) also take off the rear wheel and put it to the side of your frame with the other wheel.

So here is what happened. The federal government legalized cannabis, but the way our govt tiers work here meant it was left to each province to implement legalization as they saw fit. Our govt at the time (and still the same now) wasn't too keen on making it legal. They were concerned about luring youths and whatnot, so they made it the highest age requirement they could get away with (nothing else is 21+ in Quebec. You can drink alcohol at 18!), and they also made it so you couldn't just browse, you had to ask someone, and thus know what you want already, etc. By comparison, the SAQ (liquor stores) is also a govt monopoly and they regularly have wine tasters in their stores as well as a points rewards system (again, they have a monopoly, what do they need a fidelity program for?

I can't help but wonder who will purchase the closed concert hall, likely at a steep discount since the owners were forced out of business. Perhaps they’ll expand their residential complex there, possibly after receiving funding support from the government.

Also, how is it possible for an entire apartment complex to be built based on a permit that was issued incorrectly? At no point during the permit process or construction were there any checks and balances to prevent this kind of situation?I

"First off, talk to your neighbor. It’s always easier to be friendly and work on the solution together.

Next option is sound proofing. Installing carpets with padding is good. New floors with a high STC level would be an other option, get quotes and bring in experts. Probably looking at 10-15$/sq.ft. Moving could also be an option, just had a friend who moved out of his upper because of this exact issue.

If you can get in touch with the owner of the below unit, it’s easier to sound proofing a ceiling than a floor (although usually you need both).

If none of the above works, document everything. Call the cops. Send lawyers letters. Contact the co-ownership. Man, I’m exhausted for you just writing that out. Going to war with a neighbor is almost never worth it, it’s easier to move.

"So, dancers can have negative attitudes towards groups of women because how you make your income is from selling dances+tips.

"I live in Montreal and I enjoyed my first visit to Toronto but not the second one. The first time we stayed close to Casa Loma, went to the Beguiling and only briefly went to the downtown core. Felt very Times Square and I recognized that my favorite show growing up (Night Heat) was shot there. 

The second time, I didn't enjoy it mainly because we visited mostly downtown and the entire place seemed under construction. Also I looked for the same Times Square feel but couldn't find it.  Your museums are wonderful though so that's where we spent most of our time. 

I just think both Montreal and Toronto suffer from a certain level of urban blight currently, much more so than in the 2010s. Also, both cities feel a lot less friendly than before the pandemic. I will say though that I feel lucky being in Montreal because people have been very welcoming to me and my terrible French (sorry it's my third language!)

"I noticed people get enraged if you honk at them or flash your high beams. even when they're in the wrong. Someone will cut me off and if I dare honk at them, I get brake checked and followed and they won't let me pass them. They'll slam the brakes and come to a full stop in the middle of the road, or they'll let you pass and then get behind you and start following you really closely and literally follow you wherever you're going

I once had a guy on Sainte-Croix riding my ass and who then passed me on the wrong side of the road because he was mad that I wasn't doing 70 in a 50 zone, so I honked at him, only for him to go around and come to a full stop and start yelling ""you fucking pussy why you honking"" and then he started honking back like a lunatic and then floored it away just to arrive at a red light 2 feet away after realizing he was holding up traffic just to rage at me.

But yea drivers in this city are awful, they have 0 sense of direction, space and lane discipline. Every lane does the same speed, making it impossible to pass. And then you have the people who get enraged if you're not going 80 in a 50 zone but these are the same people who do 60 in 100 zones on the highway

Even on the Met and Decarie, I never understood why everyone does 60 km/h even at night when it's not that congested as during the day.

My thoughts:

- I liked the way the rule that posts must be Montreal area related was enforced. There is r/Quebec, r/Canada, r/AskACanadian, r/OnGuardForThee, etc, etc so there are plenty of other places to post about stuff not specific to Montreal. Some interesting posts were deleted from time-to-time, but there used to be a Freedom Friday thread where people could post about anything.

- The downvotes in this sub are crazy. I'm subbed to like 30 subs and this is the only one I have to sort by new, not because I want to see the latest posts, but because so many posts get downvoted to oblivion. Why? Is it French vs English? Witch hunts? I know it's just fake internet points, but it's sad to see people who put time into a good post only to be downvoted for no apparent reason. I don't know what the solution is, maybe remove the downvote button like some other subs do?

"I had a friend who was fined once for this (it was legitimately her fault, though).

  
The way they fine you if you live in a plex/condo building is they find some item in the trash that has an address on it, and issue a fine to that address which you receive in your mailbox. She found this out when she went to contest the fine, and got out of it on a technicality because the piece of mail that they used had misspelled her name.

So, as long as you are vigilant about ensuring your trash is correctly handled, you should be fine. Also: get a shredder for mail that has your address on it, and put it in the recycling!",Montreal

"Don't sweat getting an expensive winter coat (like a Kanuk) if you don't have the means.

Our winters are not as brutal as they used to be.  We still have temps below -30C occasionally but they rarely last more than a day or two now.

You will be fine with a base layer (cotton or wool blend), a thick sweater, a thick hoody and any half decent winter coat (with pockets for your hands) over it. Most days, you'll only use some of this clothing. 

Also, very important is to cover your head and ears with a warm tuque and scarf. 

Invest in decent, water-resistant, boots to make sure your feet don't get wet and freeze (like Kamiks). 

As for your hands, aside from thick mittens that are kinda useless for everyday wear, you need pockets in your coat to put your gloved hands in to keep them semi-warm.

An implant is typically $5000- 6000.

Some people have mutant  3 root molars that have an extra 4th root (like mine did!), and if the dentist doesn't do a thorough inspection using a modern dental microscope, they'll miss it.

If it's more dull pain , and it was roughly two weeks ago, it could still be healing, especially if there was a bad infection as your body takes time to fill the hole where the tooth root meets your jawbone.

"I used to hate these people but I transformed this attitude into an attitude of compassion.  It's the best you can do. You have to remember that anyone that would ask for change or harrass someone is not having a good life. Happy people don't bother people/happy people don't hurt people. I always think, ""It could be me, if things went different in my life and I wasn't as lucky..this could be me.""
These people represent a realm of living that's at the end of misfortune. When one's karma bears rotten fruit. If their acts are forgivable,  forgive them. Carrying anger or hate only hurts you and certainly doesn't help the overall problem. Maybe take this as an opportunity to practice compassion.  It takes a lot of practice.",Montreal

There's many cave systems under the island. Some require breathing gear, some from the water but others because the air isn't safe or doesn't have enough oxygen.

Many are accessible if you know where. People who do, don't usually say as they are EXTREMELY dangerous. If you know what you're looking for a topo map, old watershed maps, and soil composition maps tell you a lot!

There's dozens of caves you can stand up in. Perhaps hundreds of you count those needing breathing gear.

There's also many old servers and water reservoirs. People live inside some so be extra careful, it isn't just the elements that can kill you!

"The hospital with the capability to accept you will be where you end up if you go by ambulance.  You won't really have a choice about it.  They'll call the nearest ones to you and whichever has a spot is where you'll end up.  

If you go to the hospital yourself, you can choose, but the ambulance will be directed to the nearest one with an opening for you.

If you're getting travel insurance, make absolutely sure that they will cover costs if you deliver in Canada.  Insurance companies are notorious for denying claims because of a 'pre-existing condition'.  Ask directly whether or not medical bills will be covered if you deliver in Canada.  If they waffle on the answer, find another insurance company.  Otherwise, you're going to have some hefty bills to deal with along with a newborn.  

I'd recommend the Glen site for the Royal Victoria hospital on Decarie in NDG simply because the Children's Hospital is in the same building and if there's a need for a pediatric specialist (hopefully not), they're literally a few hundred meters away and can be there in under five minutes in an emergency.  Since they're one of the more recently built hospitals in the city, they have the most up to date equipment.

According to the law, every hospital has to serve you in English, so finding an English hospital is not really a priority.  You want the best care, not linguistically correct care.  There might be a bit of a language barrier, but from my experiences in different hospital ERs in the city, you can get service in either language without a problem.  Once you're in a room for recovery, you might face more of a problem, but they won't jeopardize your health because you speak English and they don't.  They'll find someone who can communicate with you.",Montreal

Heureusement que c' est un salaire décent pour un emploi dans mes compétences. Pour d'autres personnes, les emplois dans leurs compétences sont loin, les horaires atypiques, puis il y a des emplois dans des endroits très mal desservis par le tec alors l'auto est inévitable.


Quand je me cherche un autre emploi, je ne regarde pas juste le salaire, je prends en considération le coûts en temps et en argent (billets, gas, stationnement, achat ou location d'auto).


Déménager n' est pas une option pour moi alors je contrôle les autres facteurs.


Autrement tu peux essayer le transport en commun si ton horaire te le permet, perso ça me stresse moins que de me battre dans le traffic et je regarde un film, lis un livre ou écoute de la musique. Tu peux décaler tes heures pour tenter d'éviter l'heure de pointe. Tu peux co-voiturer (1 auto de moins, moins cher en gas, un peu plus plaisant en bonne compagnie).

"I’ve somewhat done it. However, it’s only when speaking with other Quebecers that it really comes together. I’ve noticed that I tend to “code shift” depending on whom I’m speaking with. I’m pretty good at changing my accent when speaking to my colleagues in Belgium or France as an example. (I also code shift in English too, with family in the UK, Australian friends and family here in Canada)

What’s really funny is when I inevitably struggle with finding my words in French and the person I’m speaking to doesn’t know that I’m actually an anglophone originally, it starts some really interesting conversations and people tend to be really surprised to learn that French isn’t my first language. 

My writing is still poor, however I can do a decent job at work with using some simple aids to help me write in a more professional setting, I used to use antidote but I find using AI translation tools and making slight adjustments myself I can get the results I want quicker than writing in French and going back and correcting it. I can still do it, But sending a quick email is just easier with AI (at least for me). I never really learnt how to use a French keyboard and boy oh boy did I have a hard time when I had to work in Belgium with an Azerty keyboard for a week.

But I travel a lot through the province, and now live full time in Quebec City and only really speak English at home with my partner who is also anglophone.

Whether I’m in Lac St Jean, Abitibi, Montreal or speaking to colleagues in Europe, I’m 95% there accent wise (and able to shift the accent quite well) but yes, writing in French is still my biggest challenge now. But it’s gotten better with time and I hope to improve it in the future.

"As someone who lived locally to the tennis during the pandemic, the AELTC received a huge payout from their insurance in 2020 due to COVID, as they took out ‘pandemic insurance’ after SARS in the early 2000s.

The local community - such as those that put drink/burger vans in their front gardens - received nothing. They gave nothing to the local community. Even at Christmas, the miserable sods didn’t even put up a Christmas tree outside the front of the main entrance.

So I don’t believe they will give anything to the local community, considering the disruption and upheaval the tennis causes (including restricting use of Wimbledon Park for the tents and queue!)

Don’t get me wrong there’s a wonderful atmosphere when Wimbledon is on, however any suggestion that AELTC cares about their Corporate and Social Responsibility is absolute rubbish.

"Until very recently I had to do this a lot. One of the strangest things I find about London is that for all its openness and tolerance, there are a surprising number of anti-dog people in the mix. Some of it is cultural, but a lot of it is due to a phobia, I think - there are quite a few people whose childhood encounters with dogs will have been with dangerous ones, and it's left a lasting impression.

That said, I've only had a couple of issues on the bus, mainly of the ""Please move, I have an allergy"" variety (which makes no sense - my wife IS allergic to dogs, and my dog is a poodle cross as a result. They still ask me to move anyway, which leads me to suspect that they actually have a phobia but are too ashamed to talk about it).

The 6 months up front is less weird. I moved from abroad and pretty much everybody asked for 6 months in advance. A few places asked for a year. If you're not sold on this particular flat, you can try Openrent and find a flat directly through a private landlord, with no agency involved.

"A big reason for the hike in charges recently (not saying it’s correct or acceptable) is insurance premiums and utility costs. Also even more recently the Build Safety Act (BSA) has added even more maintenance costs for increased insurance premiums if you have a high rise building (over 18m I believe)

It’s best to look into how you can form or be apart of a residents association. If it’s a relatively new build development a lot of the developers will then pass on the freehold to the residents as there isn’t any reason for them to hold onto the freehold.

When i was buying my new build flat that was one of the two big selling points for me, its low rise building (6 stories) and the developers handover the freehold once all units are sold and the residents are in control of the block management.",London

"Cargo ebikes are a fantastic alternative to cars to take kids to their local activities. For journeys <2-3 miles they're likely to be the fastest and most convenient means of transportation

But:

* they are hugely expensive; some cost more than motorcycles. If a parent can also use it to cycle to work and can get it via a salary sacrifice scheme, it's one thing. But if they cannot use it to commute to work and/or still need a car, then the cost becomes simply too high in most cases
* they are hard to store. They don't fit traditional bike hangars, and, even if they did, risk of theft would be too high. This also means it's virtually impossible to store one in a newbuild flat. You basically need access to a back garden to store it.

As always, the deciding factor is what kind of bus stop is it: is there just one bus route using that stop?

"Of course it got approved - Merton after all are the Council that ignored Wandsworth's objections to expanded waste handling by the Company that just two weeks ago covered Wandsworth in a blanket of ash and toxic soot for most of a week. Why? Because that's just how they roll. Wandsworth are not ""happy"" with Merton's historic record on project management, keeping outside parties to their stated commitments and you only have to look at the nonsense that went on with the Football club for two decades to see why. 

I don't give a shit about the golf course - it's a stupid relic of a more Know-your-place-Serfs time and did little to nothing for anyone local - but on the other hand it didn't do any harm either and provided small but again, harmless employment for a few. Doing no harm is an understatement when compared to what's proposed. And considering the massive underuse of the Tennis Complex through a huge chunk of the year, it can also be accused of not exactly being a friend to the local environment either. 

This is going to create fucking years of even heavier traffic for the construction through many local (and unsuitable) roads that are already dangerously congested - funnily enough from the 600+ heavy waste lorries hauling flammable crap to the aforementioned Waste handling plants daily. None of that it mitigated by anything proposed - it's just going to massively increase traffic and ""hope for the best and keep quiet about it."" 

I've read the comments on 'Nimbys' - and some of the locals really do come over as some of the most unattractively entitled knobs you'll come across (some, by no means all) but they are about to get another shit sandwich on their doorstep for very little upside. The upside is ALL on those that will get slightly richer. 

And less than £200k bunged at Southfields and Wimbledon Park tube? That'll barely cover a wash and brush up with new paint - it'll do nothing to make either of them any better at dealing with the stupidly dangerous levels of overcrowding during tournaments. Perhaps it'll provide a couple of extra bodies in hi-vis. 

All the bollocks about ""Good for Economy"" basically means good for those proposing it, as pointless as all the other Trickle-Down lies for everyone else. 

Tl/Dr: Most of London won't give a toss, the tennis-crowd want it to happen and they have money and clout going for them, and Merton Council are very obliging.

- Try OpenRent - you can manage viewings and the whole process with the landlord (no agents involved).

- Always go for a viewing before signing. Double check the inventory matches what you see.

- Don’t be shy of sharing on social media (perhaps to close friends only) that you are looking for accommodation. Plenty of landlords do not use any platform other than the recommendations they get trough their current tenants.

- TfL is great but pricey, always calculate if the cost of commute compensates the rent, otherwise just rent something closer.

- Mould: you will notice UK Supermarkets have a full range of products for this. Is the crap weather. Try “HG Mould spray”. Always wear a mask when cleaning it. 

Never In my 5+ years here found a place with virtually no mould.

- Mould part 2: regularly clean dishwasher and washing machines with anti mould and vinegar. Even if flatshare, be the one with this initiative and your lungs will thank you for it.

"This, and all the comments are really sad to read. Help in need is scarce in major cities, partially fuelled by anonymity. I’m glad that there is always someone willing to help, and I’m not trying to protect all the other tens or hundreds of people who don’t do anything, but I’d like to offer some insight into what *might* be going on in *some* people (I know it’s not everyone’s story, but if it is mine, it could be someone else’s too). 

I have a panic disorder, which can be triggered by a lot of things (things like the tube or small closed spaces or crowds etc etc), but 2 things that can really trigger me is fainting and throwing up. I have a literal phobia of fainting and of throwing up (both of others and myself). (by fainting I mean the act of collapsing without knowing if the cause is life threatening or not). 

This is on my mind quite a lot when I’m in public, especially in crowded places. Every time I’ve seen someone collapse in public, I go into a panic attack, a mini-shock where my ears are ringing and my vision is blurred, world is spinning, heart pounding and muscles freezing up, and all I can think of is that I need to get myself out of here. It’s not fun and it’s not because I don’t care about the other person. 

Not sure where this came from, maybe I’ve seen some shit when I was younger that I don’t remember, who knows. 

I’ve recently been to a major arena concert that was packed (spent the days leading up to it anxious about the possible triggers), and then had to remove myself from the crowd and sit down and collect myself multiple times, each time I saw someone faint.

The other day I almost left the ER waiting room, the fucking ER where I was with an emergency for myself, because someone kept throwing up. All I could do was cry and power through the panic and stop myself from leaving (which I seriously considered), just because someone was throwing up for a while. 

I did help someone once, a guy who collapsed in front of me in a crowd. I got the paramedics to get there (the guy in the end walked out on his own two feet, so didn’t need to go to the hospital), but boy did I go into a shock as soon as he was cared for. 

So all of this to say - you don’t know what’s going on in someone else’s head. Are there people who think their time or work is more precious than a stranger’s life? Probably. But there are also people who are just trying to hold it together due to a faulty brain, while low key hating themselves that they are unable to help.

Edit: PS: this is not for all situations where help is needed, just specifically collapsing and throwing up. I’ve helped girls out of situations where they were harassed on the tube.",London
"We need the full rebuild version of Euston for HS2, with 11 high speed platforms and mid platform entrance/exit stairs for the others.

"I believe the house price to income ratio in London eclipses New York on average.

This means that due to shorter supply, even in renting, relative to New York, there is little incentive to be a good landlord.

Capitalism works. But it’s not necessarily kind.

"In my ideal world, the land would never have been sold and the whole thing would be a nice public park. I guess with the state of council finances however, the only way to get some nice renovations is to have AELTC fund it and concede to a part private development as a result. 

* AELTC are contributing funds to improve the park which is good, but this was only brought about due to public opposition. It is contested whether AELTC already have a legal obligation (as part of their purchase of the land) to fund certain of these public improvements. 
* Building disruption is a short termist argument against the development. But the public benefit part of the development is built last, which is a shame
* AELTC haven’t demonstrated the need for a large show court in my opinion, which is a major point of contention due to its large size vs being open green space. 
* If anyone is to develop there (not that there is really much legal basis for anyone else to), I believe AELTC will do so to a high standard. 
* I do believe it’s a shame that the venue is used for essentially for only 2-4 weeks / year. Albeit this period seems long enough when Southfields tube is overwhelmed. 
* I expect that the legal implementation of the public park will be strong enough to prevent access being withdrawn, which is another major resident argument/concern against the development. 
* I unfortunately see a lack of an opposing negotiating position from any of the parties including councillors and MPs as to what they would find acceptable for the development.
* Still not happy that the public park is used as a car park.

I didn't see her fall but noticed a few people standing round

I said to my wife that we should go over and see if help was needed

My *wife* said no, there are enough people there already

Just goes to show that it's not everyone's first response to go over and help.  My wife is a very decent, helping sort of person, but she thought the situation was in hand.  There were enough people on the scene

I went over to see if I could help

Those who were standing around were simply standing around.  No one knew what to do

""She'll have to go to hospital""
""Well I can't go""
""I've to collect the kids""
""My husband needs me at home""

People also haven't had first aid training I get that too

I do have first aid training so I could ""take charge""

For every 1 bad landlord you’ll find 5 bad tenants. Then there’s favouritism where the letting agents will keep the best tenants for themselves or members of their families, friends or large investors.

"Some constructive criticism:

Remove the bells as birds can rip out the inside and choke on them. The hooks/clips for cage attachment are common in toys, but also not great as birds can get their beak stuck in them, especially parrots that are notorious for chewing shiny objects.

Bamboo is not a good choice for perches as it is too smooth and the bird will struggle to climb it. Also a variety of branches in different thickness is necessary to prevent (can’t remember the exact name, but it’s essentially blistering). Make sure main branches are fully horizontal as long term leaning can cause pain, just like sleeping or sitting incorrectly can cause pain for humans.

Also she, yes bird is a she (for those who don’t know), needs budgie seed and a cuttlebone for calcium. Fresh fruit and vegetables are necessary at all times. Avoid stuff like lettuce as it’s mostly water and very little vitamins. Sweet fruit should be used as a treat and not as a main diet in high proportion. Research what foods are budgie safe and some are not.

As for the future, don’t get other females with her as they will fight usually. Especially this one as she is quite hormonal. You can see this from the thickness of the cere and its colour. One or two males as companions would be better. However, if you get more birds you need a much larger cage. To prevent breading behaviours, never introduce a breeding box or dark places of any kind. Breeding can be detrimental to health if done wrong and can also cause fights.",London

"Everyone always complains about the 60s rebuild, which did away with the [grand arch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Euston_Arch.jpg) and [old concourse](https://blog.railwaymuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/1996-7316_cr_a_104.jpg?w=633) that people like to wax lyrical about every time this comes up.

But honestly, I'm not sure they're right. Its everything that's been bolted onto the station *since* that's the problem. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eaic-niXYAEDQL2.jpg:large) is how it looked when it was first built, and its almost completely unrecognisable compared to today. I have trouble orienting myself in that space — I'm reasonably sure its looking South-East, towards the British Library and the Bus Station, but it took me a while to get there.

And [the outside](https://emap-romulus-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2023/08/euston-station-architectural-review.jpg) is a lot better too. Sure, its like living in a Jacques Tati film, but at least you can actually move.

Okay, whacking a car park over the top is inexcusable, but it was the 60s and most people don't have to deal with that part of the station. I'll allow them the one cock-up.

&nbsp;

And the only people we can blame are the Government. When Network Rail's funding is barely enough to even keep the infrastructure functional, it isn't a surprise they've had to devote more and more of their station assets to retail space. And the HS2 rebuild, which was supposed to fix all this, has now been completely scrapped *twice*, and is now a complete mess which will not only fail to fix the crowding issue, but also permanently cripple the capacity of the entire HS2 project and may not even go ahead at all. For a cost higher than if they'd just left the whole thing alone and built the original plan as designed under *Blair*.",London

Expanding platforms on a station that's out in the open would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive enough: it's not just a matter of building wider platforms, they have to move the tracks and the cabling as well... and that just the two most obvious complications.

It's going to be that much more complicated on the actual underground stretches of the Tube, where the tunnels would have to be widened to accommodate moving the tracks and widening the platform. Not just stations, but whole stretches of the tube line would have to be shut down for months, if not years, for that kind of construction.

"A former police officer was arrested in Molenbeek. He was armed and wearing his old uniform. The man was given an automatic resignation in April 2023.

 A former police officer was placed under arrest warrant after being arrested while he was armed and wearing his old uniform in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, said the Brussels prosecutor's office, confirming information from the daily Le Soir.

“Last Sunday, the police in the Brussels-West zone were called to a family dispute in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. Later in the evening, a second call was made to the same address, this time to report that a person was trying to enter the building,” explains the prosecution.  An armed man in a police uniform was on site when police patrols arrived. “It quickly became apparent that this person was falsely posing as an agent,” points out the prosecution. 
The individual was cooperative, was questioned and then made available to the Brussels public prosecutor's office, which requested an investigating judge.

*According to the daily, the former local Brussels police officer would have served between 2019 and 2023 before receiving an automatic resignation in April 2023 for acts of extreme violence committed in 2022 in the Laeken police station*. 

“According to the first elements of the investigation, the suspect would have been a police officer in a Brussels police zone, but this information remains to be verified,” adds the Brussels prosecutor’s office. 

“The police uniform he wore belonged to his possible former employer. The weapon he carried as part of his uniform appears to be a private weapon,” he added. The individual was placed under arrest warrant and charged with harassment, illegal wearing of a uniform, theft of title, carrying a weapon subject to authorization.

Sella ou zélé : Ce terme désigne un « habitat » ou un « lieu habité ». Il vient du latin « cella » qui signifie « chambre » ou « petit espace clos ».

Broek - Sella 

Ainsi, Bruxelles se traduirait initialement par « habitation dans les marais » ou « village dans les marais ».",Brussels

"Emanuele Licari is in 8th place on the list of Vlaams Belang for the City of Brussels for the upcoming municipal elections. The Italian has a long career in far-right circles. This is evident from, among other things, his personal website, where he uses fascist symbols several times. List leader Sonja Hoylaerts says she was not aware.

On his personal website, Emanuele Licari presents himself as a fervent supporter of far-right ideologies, extensively discussing his political positions and activities. He does this exclusively in French.
A photo he posted on January 31 this year immediately catches the eye: he is posing in front of a flag showing the fasces, the Italian counterpart of the swastika and symbol of fascism. The symbol originally comes from ancient Rome and it symbolized power and authority. The symbol was later adopted by Italian fascism under Benito Mussolini, who founded the Partito Nazionale Fascista in 1921, with the fasces forming part of the party logo.
“Very nice meeting of the Nation movement and a beautiful speech by the chairman Yvan Benedetti,” Licari wrote with the photo. “I would also like to thank the friends of Casa Pound for kindly welcoming me into their spaces and presenting me with a membership card.”

Licari has been a member of Nation for decades and was also its spokesperson for a time. The far-right movement was founded in 1999 by Hervé Van Laethem, who was previously a member of the neo-Nazi movement L’Assaut. Casa Pound, the other organization he talks about in the post, is an Italian neo-fascist movement.
In another photo, Licari describes his nostalgia for his time as chairman of the youth movement of the former Belgian party Front National. The far-right party was founded in 1985 by Daniel Féret. Due to several political and legal scandals, the party ceased to exist in 2012. In 2006, Féret was convicted of violating the anti-racism law and lost his political rights for ten years.

Symbolism in personal life

Licari’s website isn’t just about his political life. He has a page dedicated to his three Persian cats, Cleopatra, Falangia and Meina. Falangia could refer to Falange Española, the Spanish fascist party founded in 1933. Meina happens to be an Italian municipality where fascists murdered more than fifty Jewish people during World War II.

Licari also posts photos of his family, including his parents. Under a photo of his father and mother, he writes: “Gaetano Licari di Castel Mola in the company of Laure Marie Delacroix.” According to Licari, his father was a war volunteer at Decima Mas at the age of 18. It was an Italian naval unit created by the fascist government of Benito Mussolini during World War II.
BRUZZ could not reach Licari for a response. List leader Sonja Hoylaerts indicated that Licari would contact us if he wanted to communicate. She herself says: “I was not aware of this and will have a thorough conversation with the man. I can’t tell you more than that. I distance myself from any form o",Brussels
"This is actually landlord's problem to solve. The other tenants have a right to access their meters and you have a right to your privacy. The meters shouldn't even be in one apartement. But that's not gonna help you. 
The only solution I see is, that you agree with them on a certain date each month that they can come and check their meters. 
They cannot expect to come just in any time they like. This is basic politeness. They cannot expect that you let them in any time they choose. You can refuse, because who knows what you were doing at the moment they came. Maybe you wanna go around in your appartement naked or whatever 😆",Brussels

"The LEZ itself is not the solution - The bulk of pollution from automotive sources is from poorly maintained vehicles circulating - those belching out black smoke that may well be legal on the basis of their immatriculation certificate but that are in fact putting out 100s or even 1000s of times their Euro-category nominal values in PM and NOx. These cars should be pulled over by police: they're usually pretty easy to catch, given the clouds of smoke that succeed them. As regards newer vehicles, a greater source of automotive pollution from the latest Euro 6a car is not from the exhaust but from the tyres and brakes. Ditto electric cars - and besides this change we shouldn't forget that up to half of air pollution is non-automotive sources.

No, the real solution is a congestion charge, like London has had for 20 years. You want to commute into Brussels? Fine, but it's gonna cost ya! All that money can then be put into improving alternative transport means.

Go to the commune's Services Étrangers with a copy of your new job contract, and they'll change you in the system - either blue-collar or white-collar. Bingo-bango, no sweat. 

If, for some ungodly reason, you don't have a job anymore, and you're not a student either, *you're still fine*. You then have to register as a jobseeker at the commune.

""Jobseeker"" is also a particular status - you are *required* to register with Actiris, the Brussels Region public employment centre, and you are *required* to send a copy of your registration to the commune. 9 times out of 10 this means going there in-person to hand over the paper. 

Actiris requires jobseekers to maintain an ""active profile"" during their job search - so you need to, like, regularly look for a job and prove to Actiris that you're doing your part to find employment.

"Hi,

Yeah, I did it, and I'm going to do it again this time too.

Basically, you show up around 7:00 AM and listen to the polling place manager do a little speech. They ask for more people than they usually get - if there are too many people, the manager (le président) can dismiss the extras. You can also say you don't speak French very well and you're likely to get dismissed too - but it's not a guarantee. 

If it so happens that only a few people show up - well, you're stuck.

These are the jobs: 

* Check people off the list x2 (don't do this one, it requires a LOT of talking)
* Load up a digital voting card x1 (stick in a blank bank card thingy, click a button, give to voter)
* Help people scan their vote into the urn x1 (I did this, LOTS of talking too, lots of standing)
* Stamp the voter card and hand back ID x1 
* Crowd control x1 (some polling places will have this)

Polls close at 16:00, but you have to stay until about 17:00 to sign all the legal documents. There's a lot. 17:00 is optimistic. I was the second-in-charge somehow (Secretary) and ended up staying until about 18:30. (I got invited by the commune's rep on-site to join her and the other presidents at the commune for a drink.) 

Tips: 

* Bring food - snacks throughout the day, maybe a lunch, definitely water. Some communes will feed you, some won't. 
* Bring comfy clothes. Not pyjamas obviously, but decently comfy to move around in. 
* Some polling stations are HOT. Deodorant and maybe an extra top. 

If you end up doing it, enjoy the day and try to make friends with your fellow poll workers. They're just as miserable about being there on a Sunday morning as you are, so try to make the best of it. 

Good luck!",Brussels

Now, why so much hate for bxl? Because of nationalism, the city used to be flemmish speaking and its technically a francophone enclave within Flanders. Flemkish people are rich nowadays compared to the rest of the country, but that has only been the case since the 50s and there is a collective memory of when they were an agrarian population moving to French speaking industrial cities for blue collar jobs.. so nowadays there is still this big animosity and rivality. Their biggest political parties are founded upon Flemmish nationalism and xenophobia, as you can inagine that mixes the perfect cocktail for having half the country describe their capital as hell on earth (while never even having lived here).

"TLDR: Essentially it was an amporphous excessively vague cross-party fudge in the first place, informed in part by some weird very ""Belgian compromise"" ideas around mobility, that was also in large part blocked from being implemented as a result of Brussels' multiple (fragmented) layers of government and bureaucracy, and by related petty bureaucratic and local politial chicanery and cowardice - and that confusingly also often isn't even what people mean when they refer to it or talk about it having failed.



Good Move is/was a very wide ranging, often quite vague ten-year strategic mobility plan, endorsed at its inception by a wide range of political parties for that purpose. There's been a succession of these strategic plans and they've always failed/gone almost nowhere - in that sense GoodMove has arguably been comparably successful (at least in being implemented). However when different people talk about it, they often mean different aspects of it, or even things that don't have much to do with it or were happening anyway (eg bike lanes are to some extent part of GoodMove to an extent but they were already being built before it was adopted,  Ixelles and Fernand Cocq are sometimes cited as examples of GoodMove when they predate it,  taking cars out of some of the Bois de la Cambre happened during the period covered by GoodMove but was not an explicit part of the ten year strategy, etc; conversely, improving public transport in various is part of GoodMove but never really gets mentioned in discussions around it).

 When people talk about it ""failing"", it's therefore often hard to really meaningfully discuss, because exactly what it meant in practice was often not very clear, much of it that can be quantified was never implemented (see the LTN/mailles, discussed below), in particular some of its most controversial aspects, and what was implemented was often a piecemeal local interpretation of some pretty vague plans.

One of the notable features of the plan was for what might be called Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in English, also known as the GoodMove mailles. There were supposed to be \*fifty\* of these by 2030, and lots of people talk as if they've been applied all over the city (by which I mean the full region of Brussels, not 1000 Brussels), or even that one giant one has been implemented across Brussels, and this (fantasy) is what they often mean by ""GoodMove"" (alternatively they often mean anything endorsed by Groen, or anything the car lobby doesn't like). 

In reality, only one major LTN/maille has been implemented (in the Pentagone), plus a handful of other very small ones amounting to a tiny handful of streets made one-way for a block or similar, for I think maybe four in total so far, plus a few more in the pipeline. Even the Pentagone one doesn't fully do what it was advertised as doing (preventing drivers from using the Pentagone as a through-route, as has been done in neighbourhoods and city centres in places such as Groningen, Gent",Brussels
"To clarify the issue here (since I got stuck behind the same thing myself when trying to get a Belgian e-SIM): Mobile Vikings says that the Belgian state requires anyone getting a SIM to be identified and the way they do that is by having your first payment go through your Belgian bank (which is of course impossible until you have a Belgian bank account, which can take quite a while, if you even want one). I'm sure future payments after this first one can be done in whatever way, since the claimed purpose is just for ID.

I asked their customer service a while ago and their suggestion was to have a friend with a Belgian account pay for it... which seems like it completely sidesteps the legal requirement and sounds like it might not even be legal, so it's a bit wild as a suggestion.

I ended up just letting the whole thing be and have just used my non-Belgian EU number for months now - but that's a pain in the ass since a ton of places require a Belgian number (cannot even get a Delhaize customer account for example).",Brussels

"Brussels has a very long tradition of theatres, vaudeville shows, and marionette shows. 

These theatres are now all mostly gone, but once in a while you can find a ""ghost"" - the one I'm thinking of is the Alhambra parking lot, which is a reference to the old Alhambra Theatre at De Brouckère, which disappeared in the early 70's and got replaced by the UGC movie theatre.

Some others were the Alcazar Theatre (rue Arenberg); the Vaudeville Theatre (Galeries de la Reine), which now is a multipurpose space available for rent; the Ambassador Cinema (Bourse), now integrated into the Marriott above the McD's; and plenty of others.

Marionette theatres in particular used to do shows entirely in Brusseleer, the Brussels dialect of Dutch. There's only one left now - Theatre de Toone. 

At one time it was possible to go out to a theatre every single night to watch a show - often a slapstick comedy/vaudeville play, then head to the nearest bar afterwards for a drink. 

The people who went to these bars often ended up making their own clubs/colours and forming loose associations that put on other events during the day - social hours, talks, workshops, etc.

To be honest though even in countries with deeper roots in coffee drinking you will rarely see a place that serves coffee to be open before 7am.

"Petillon is a nice, safe area.

Generally speaking Brussels is not a dangerous city, crime wise. It is perhaps a bit on the rough side by the standards of western European capitals, in particular (comparatively speaking) in some areas downtown (as it hasn't exported its poverty and social problems to peripheral estates as much as eg Paris), but not by a great margin, and that is in the context of a very safe region by international standards. I don't know anyone who has had any problems with crime in many years, and I and some acquaintances are fairly frequently around some areas considered rough such as the Gare du Midi. The stuff on here is a mix of standard paranoia from people who read too many tabloids and social media, racism and Flemish nationalism, and whatever the bias is that is caused by people always posting negative incidents while the millions of people who had a normal day post nothing. You can tell that the people insisting it's dangerous are full of it as they'll also insist it's much less safe now than back in the good old days (as someone does here in this thread), when the statistics show violent crime here has dropped heavily over the past few decades (also in line with my anecdotal experience - 30 years ago street crime did feel like a real threat, and loads of people I know got mugged back then).

That does not mean Brussels doesn't have its problems. It is for example polluted and noisy and (on garbage day) dirty, and in particular it suffers from a genuine safety problem, that gets ignored amongst all the pearl clutching about ""crime"": a combination of heavy car traffic, very aggressive drivers and very badly designed junctions that can make it very unpleasant and to some degree unsafe to walk around, plus (if relevant) very very poor bike infrastructure. But street crime is not a major issue, in particular where you'll be.",Brussels

Take all of this, get a normal appointment with your social worker or someone more relevant if deemed necessary and casually and calmly explain to them something along the line of ""Hello, here is all I could gather myself to help you help me get my files in order. Unfortunately I haven't had any revenues since july and I fear my landlord is going to be angry if I don't pay rent soon, please help me to get this in order or find any other way I haven't think about""

Then from an urbanism point of view, there also are problems. A lot of cities implemented a passing through policy for stations, limiting drastically the amount of waiting spaces. This leads to less people being in the station and higher chances to be isolated in my opinion, and surely stations with more activities and attractivity would feel like a better option.

Security measures are part of the solution in the short term. But they will never amount to much on the long term. Petty criminality drivem by drug use does not work like that.

There are a lot of rules that protect the customer and 20 years ago going into a local shop meant the best customer service you could get. Last time I went to a Proximus shop to buy usb-c headphones, I asked the seller it they were compatible with my phone and he said yes. I paid twice the price of that product on Amazon and when I opened the box and checked that it worked, it didn't. Hence I asked to be reimbursed but the guy said that he couldn't do that as I had already openned the box. I explained to him that inducing somebody to buy something by saying something wrong cancel the sale by law. And the guy simply said he couldn't do anything without the owner of the shop that was not present. I had to come back a few times and he was never there. Say what you want about Amazon, but so far they have never refused a return from me.

I go to local shops for their expertise. I am happy to pay a little bit more at the computer shop because I know that they will go above and beyond and that in practice it's more like a 5 years warranty than the 2 on paper.

Here’s the translation I quickly made:

My neighbour's daughter just turned 18. With her friends, she decided to go to the city to party. Before going home, she decided to go eat a pita, rue du Marché aux Fromages. During the night, she got cramps. She ended up going to the hospital because the pain became unbearable. The doctor decides to give her a gastric lavage. The results showed that the pita contained six different sperm samples. When the men were arrested. They explained that they were motivated by a feeling of revenge.

"My wife drove from Brussels to Ghent 2-3 days/week for work for 2 years. We used to live in Woluwe SP and the traffic delays used to occur when she was on the Brussels ring or the tunnels to get in/out of Brussels. On an average, based on when she left the house (her target was always 7.30-7.45 am) and when she could leave work - it took between 1-1.5 h one way, most of the days. The highway doesn’t have stand still traffic and there could be delays, some days, but it’s mostly a breeze compared to the traffic in Brussels. As an expat, and who wants to live in Brussels - you’ll probably be drawn to the Etterbeek/Ixelles/Woluwe communes. Commuting by car from these locations to the Brussels ring will be the biggest PAIN. The alternative is public transport - and you will get connectivity via public transport to the train stations but consider door to door time and not just the train journey because you need to factor in delays/missed connections/strikes/etc. Also please factor in your resistance to the Belgian weather (windy, incessant wind + light rain, general gloominess) which you will be exposed to when using public transport options. It could be grating for some who aren’t used to it. 

Consider Gent as an alternative to move to, unless your husband’s work is in Brussels in which case the commute from Gent to Brussels and back is significantly more worse. 

You can consider alternatives such as those suggested in this thread such as Aalst/Asse/Groot-Bijgaarden or in Brussels closer to the ring such as Koekelberg etc, but if you do so you will partially miss out on the expat experience of living in Brussels -> not that this is something spectacular, but for some this could be important - access to locals + expats, networking events, bunch of cafes and restaurants, shopping, things to do/see -> sprinkle that with doses of street crime, and very specific Brussels problems.",Brussels

I would highly recommend you get in touch with a local Belgian animal shelter/ dog adoption association to help you with all the admin work. 

It is illegal in Belgium for private individuals to adopt out cats and dogs over the internet. Only accredited NGOs or breeders can. Also, as of a couple of years ago all pet owners must get a permit from their commune in order to keep a new cat or dog.

Passing through an association will help you make sure everything is in order and they can help you with your reach to interested adoptive families, as well as fosters (so that the puppies are in a home - even yours if you can! - while they wait for their forever family, rather than a pound!).

Do this:

* Go check if you are allowed to work. You can usually find this information somewhere in your visa. If yes, then how many hours per week? For lots of international students this is 20 hours/week. 
* Student jobs are a particular category of job - you can work up to 600 hours per calendar year (January to Deccember) practically tax-free. You can do this at www.studentatwork.be. Go check how many hours you have already used for the year 2024.
* Make sure you don't run out of hours. When you have 0 hours left, some jobs will literally just... let you go. The contract is over. Others will offer to bring you on via a ""regular"" contract but you'll pay the same taxes as everybody else.

Make SURE that you build in ""study time"" and ""rest time"" into your schedule, as well as ensuring that both potential jobs don't overlap.

It does hot water as well as heating and it's 25 kW.",Brussels
"My son broke the key to the door of the house while coming back from first day of school. Called me during lunch break, had to cancel mtg at work, take half day off and waiting for locksmith who told me to have cash at hand around 3-400€...",Brussels

I assume that there will be trains running again in December, though because of the change of timetables that always happens in mid-December, booking periods only open later, see also: [https://www.seat61.com/european-train-booking-horizons.htm](https://www.seat61.com/european-train-booking-horizons.htm)",Brussels
"Not justifying this, but the ease with which Indian IT and other workers  have been able to migrate to Belgium because of a purported skills shortage after an influx of Ukrainians has totally deflated salaries in many sectors and caused a lot of frustration especially amongst older workers who find their wages flatlining.

EDIT: repeat , NOT justifying this. Racism in Flanders is real , open and widespread. I clarified this further in comments hereunder. I confess I find myself looking for explanations sometimes, as what I also didn’t make clear as that, I also have experienced it as a dark skinned southern  European.. it’s when I open my mouth and certain people hear an American accent or an accent they think is British that attitudes change.",Brussels
"Never pay anything in cash or into a private bank account. You cannot trace or prove any payment if future problems arise. 

The only legal way to pay a deposit is through a blocked bank account/e-deposit. This way the landlord can't access the money without your approval. 

If it's done in another way, it's a sign the landlord is not officially declaring the apartment/studio/rent. If you run into any issues, you have no leg to stand on.",Brussels
"I think questions like this (trend in this sub) are contributing to make Brussels a no safe place. If there are concerns about some part of the city like Molenbeek or Laeken, please discuss with the police and bring the topic to the local government (""conseil communal"" and not ""commune"" as the later is an administration and not a political body). Things can be fixed, not in a short term but in a long term yes.

If people had issue with a specific nationality or skin color, I can't help sorry. (always the same question in the sub, asking about the nationality of the robber or attacker).

Off topic, I want the regional and local governments in Brussels to invest in education, education and education. We should be patient, we will not see the results now, but we will see it in 10 years or more.",Brussels

"I see it as a sign of the downfall of Europe. 
We see that Europe is basically France and Germany running the show.

The EU citizens are not better off. Belgium is even worse as our politicians sold us out to get seats in the different EU institutions. 

It’s heavily geared toward capitalism and we see all the downfall like the privatisation of energy. 

The immigration debacle, the Schengen zone debacle,...

All we can say is that the EU hasn’t the greatest track record.

The Future was Europe but technocrates have killed it.",Brussels
"Place Flagey kind of has everything: nature, culture, public space, night life, fries.

Vossenplein flea market? I certainly go there regularly.

Sewer museum is a treasure. What other city has this?

Bois de la Cambre is super important but just too big to count, I think.",Brussels
Good luck for your search! In a similar situation here but just moved from Brussels to Italy as well and looking for a babysitter here...Do you know by chance where in Italy has moved your reliable babysitter? Italy is big but maybe I am lucky...,Brussels
"If you want to stop using the Proximus cabling, the only alternative you have is Telenet or Orange (who uses Telenet coax cabling). Edpnet, scarlet, viking all use Proximus cabling as well.

Or you have to go for a 4G/5G based solution such as Tadaam. Check if you have good 4G coverage with your phone when you are in your home.

EDIT: Base now also has an offer for Internet, it uses Telenet coax cabling.",Brussels
"Are you living in the same house as the landlord? If yes, I'd recommend looking into moving somewhere else. Not ideal I know especially as a student. But if he's talking about your breasts and being touchy-feely after such a short time, he could escalate.

If no, how much time/contact are you having with him? Is there a way of limiting this contact, ie having one of the other housemates act as main point of contact?

Maybe I've read too many Reddit stories but my mind went to hidden cameras. There are many videos online on how to check if you've not yet checked your room.

There are lots of resources here https://www.commissioner.brussels/ and you can also message them for advice.

Stay safe!",Brussels
"A way to combat cars in cites would have been electric bikes,trottinetes etc to be pushed heavily both from the government and the private sector, in conjunction with public transport for longer distances, but certain parts of the population consider them ""an eyesore"" and want the gone, totally ignoring the *millions* of 1t metal monstrosities taking a huge chunk of space to go around, while spewing fumes.",Brussels
