0,His top 2 priorities should be getting all the tracks fixed on the subway lines and make the TTC safe again by allowing the special constables to use their full power.  Not just kick people out of the station to return and cause more problems. If need be hire paid duty officers if there are not enough special constables. (Paid duty allows the cops to stay in the stations and not get redirected to a higher priority call outside of the station. This was a problem with the TPS transit unit)

The Proof House on commercial street? Gunmakers, was build mid century, still there now if you fancy a look. The Royal London Hospital. 

On Stepney Green there is one house remaining (No. 37) that has survived from the 18th century. Was a street for the wealthy - the first person to have lived at no. 37 was a slave owner, later residents included people involved with the East India Company. That sort of thing!

The Geffrye Museum in Hoxton might be of interest to you - it's a museum about how middle class folk lived and decorated their homes over the centuries. There's different rooms for each century. It's also a converted set of 18th Century almshouses too."

14,"A Eurostar stop at International would make sense if there were a non-terrible connection to Stratford main. DLR doesn't cut it as it runs every ten minutes (even with the proposed frequency boost, five).

Open up the western entrance (51.544814,-0.006248) as an international terminal. Create a cut-and-cover walkway under Hitchcock Lane and Montfichet Way to Subway C ([map](https://assets.nationalrail.co.uk/e8xgegruud3g/3i8ZS2diMrtkIHc3ijxZRG/2a2a78f5d25acb8ffc7dc111c581447e/Stratford_july_2024.pdf)) of Stratford main.

The other advantage of opening up Stratford International as an international station is that Stratford International has a rail link to the West Coast Mainline and a reinstateable link to the Great Western Mainline. If international facilities could be built at stations on those lines (big 'if') it would allow direct Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow or Manchester to Paris and Brussels. The block allocation on those services would be quite inefficient, so might be best run as night services or off-peak only."

We need transit right where the 401 is badly. Go buses are not it and do not fill the need.

I don't mind the hole, but either move the 401 underground and change the above ground to trains, or just build a subway under the 401 that runs from durham to halton. Make em frequent too. 

So many cars off the 401 with that. We don't need lanes, we need alternatives.

I'd happily take transit to work if it didn't take 1.5-2 hrs due to the transit layout being 3 buses and being stuck in traffic anyway. It's 25-35 mins by car."
24,"Having had the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù of attending quite a few board events for my employer, Giles is a known provincial conservative loyalist, despite his fraudulent claims of being non-political. If you ever listen to him speak, it‚Äôs obvious he has no vision and no ideas. 

Congestion is a major issue. TRBOT‚Äôs job is to represent the interests of its members. Its important to recognize that TRBOT is a PRIVATE organization that has no responsibility to the wider public. The members all have different opinions on the matter of congestion, but its clear that Giles hates bikes, hates transit, and can only dream of highways.

What I will also say is that the TRBOT staffers at the director level or lower actually ARE intelligent, curious people capable of critical thought. Talk to these folks and you‚Äôll get a real understanding of the key barriers to progress in Toronto. As they tell me: the executive tier of the board only wants an echo chamber. 

Look at who the executives at TRBOT are: Giles is a former deputy ministry, with a conservative pedigree. Roselle Martino is a former ADM, with a conservative pedigree, Jennifer Vander Valk is a career bureaucrat , Brenda Gardiner has a track record of failure everywhere she has ever been (when she‚Äôs not buying pointless awards, of course), Sharon Fernandes has no business being on the executive (Sharon who?), and recent addition Trevor Dauphinee is‚Ä¶ another career bureaucrat!

No one on the executive of the board of trade has actually conducted meaningful commerce in their entire career. 

So, what happened? Well let‚Äôs look at the composition of the board of directors. Yung Wu is at the heart of the problem. He only understands tech, and thinks every business should be tech. He likes to think of himself as Canada‚Äôs Elon Musk, inviting pointlessly disruptive ideas to the table. Other than Yung, there is no one on the board that has ever started or operated a business except that one guy who runs a real estate holding company. 

No one on this board of directors actually gives a shit about business, so they hired an executive team who serves a single purpose: get meetings with government officials so they can take selfies to inflate their self worth and report back to their employers.

My advice: read the reports published by TRBOT. They are informative and insightful and fact-based (for the most part). I recommend you IGNORE the recommendations in these reports, because the recommendations are clearly bought and paid for and often are non-sequiturs from the rest of the report. I know, we have ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù some of these reports in the past. 

TL;DR the board shills for ‚Äúdigahole Doug‚Äù because CEO Giles Gherson is besties with Doug and Vic Fidelli. He‚Äôs in this role because a bunch of corporate nobodies want selfies with politicians."

27,"I worked in an office tower and arrived that morning to find my co-workers glued to the TV. We saw the second plane hit. 

I remember trying to log on to CNN but the servers were so overloaded, you couldn't get online. That really freaked me out. We all wanted to go home early but our boss was being a real dick about it and only relented when some people started crying. That was when I started my habit of identifying emergency exits whenever I go to a new building. I still do it. 

A few weeks later, I was working on a project based in Washington DC. We have to travel by driving because plane travel wasn't reliable enough yet. Then while in DC, the anthrax attacks started. We were working in big federal buildings for the week and everyone was on edge. It's hard now to overstate the sense of fear and paranoia that permeated the atmosphere at that time. 

A few months later, I worked on a project that re-united Americans who had been stranded in Canada with the communities they'd been in. It was right around Christmas time but every single person we worked with was happy to get on a plane and travel for up to 18 hours to get back to places like Gander Nfld. They were so attached to the people who'd taken them in for the week. 

Come From Away covers some of this, but it's worth looking into other sources to understand how scared the people stranded on those planes were. We didn't have smart phones then and a lot of cell service was down so they couldn't reach their families. Some people thought a nuclear war had started. There's some incredible footage of people being unloaded from planes and going into the school where they were going to sleep, and seeing the footage on TV for the first time. 

As others have said, the effects of this event are still very much a part of our every day lives"
28,"There are more and more shows at MTelus where tickets for the balcony are sold as reserved seating, so you should first confirm what the setup is for your specific show. When you go on Ticketmaster it'll be clear on the seating chart if the venue is all GA or of the balcony is reserved seating only.

Doors usually open 1.5-2 hours prior to show time and the entire balcony has bar stool seating, not just the first row. 

So if what you are looking for is just any seat, show up whenever but you may have to sit in the last few rows where sound and visibility are usually less than ideal. If you want one of the stools in the first row around the ledge of the balcony, then you need to arrive early, those are usually the first ones to be taken."

51,"The solution to Brussels‚Äô escalating crime problem is simple: divide the city into 13 isolated districts, each encased by high walls, impenetrable and heavily fortified. Every district would be completely self-contained, with no interaction allowed between them, ensuring that problems are kept where they originate. Criminal elements would be forced to remain within their designated zones, unable to cross into more stable areas, while resources and basic necessities would be rationed and distributed by the authorities to maintain order.

This system would not only allow for more effective containment of crime but also for stricter oversight of each zone‚Äôs population. Without the ability to move freely, criminal networks would collapse, forced into submission by limited access and constant surveillance. The government could establish checkpoints for essential movement, though severely restricted, minimizing any opportunity for chaos to spread beyond a district's walls.

Brussels could finally achieve control‚Äîrigid, structured control‚Äîwhere lawlessness is confined and security is absolute. This isn't just a solution; it‚Äôs the future of urban governance.

56,"They sometimes give grossly inflated tickets. Sometimes in error. The process to contest takes a long time, and they‚Äôll try to get you to pay up until the very last minute. You‚Äôll miss part of a workday doing it. But you might win, and if you do, esp. if you‚Äôre in the right, it will feel damn good. Other people might benefit from knowing about the process.

57,"You are a wonderful person. Look at the stats of CPR actually working - it's low 

 But you gave that person their best shot. You YOU were right there with them holding their hand, letting them know people care. If they did pass and their family obtain details, they will always know he got the very best chance there and he wasn't alone.

Amazing you."
58,"The controversy regarding Vince is overshadowed by the benefits of retiring his jersey. It's mainly a marketing move. It puts more eyeballs on the Raptors on what is likely to be another development year for the team.

Based on how he left I am not happy his is the first jersey the Raptors choose to retire (would prefer Lowry to be given that honour). I'm not bitter, I like the older and mature Vince. But that does not mean that his actions at the time he left the Raptors should be discounted."

66,"Just stop allowing right turns on red in the downtown core.

A huge portion of the reason people 'block the box' is because if a driver proceeding straight were to always only go when it's clear, they'll die of old age waiting for that opportunity, as cars from their right simply fill any gap immediately by turning right on red. If you're not *really* aggressive in going straight and cutting off those right-turners, you can sometimes sit there for 5+ full light cycles and not move an inch. So you have drivers who gun it into the middle of the intersection and get stuck because they are tired of seeing a spot past the intersection open up and get filled right away."
67,"Where is Olivia Chow? She needs to shut this up as fast as possible.

74,"Mass of average car: 1500kg. Travelling only 20km/h equates to over 23000J of kinetic energy

When a car crashes into a person, the kinetic energy is transferred into the human body, and y'know, breaks your bones and effs up your organs, which can injure/kill you. 

Mass of average cyclist plus bike: 80kg. The cyclist would have to travel about **87km/h** to match the kinetic energy of a car travelling a mere 20km/h. 

An average mass pedestrian (70kg) would have to run over 92km/h to match the same kinetic energy. 

Real world scenarios are obviously more complicated than can be represented by high school physics formulae but it's nonsensical to subject everyone to the exact same rules when only one method of transportation kills over a million people per year. Apples and orange soda. 

--------------

The driver, of course, almost never makes full stops at stop signs either (especially if there's no cross traffic), and if he were to bike, he would certainly not stop fully either - because that's what we would all do. We know absolutely nothing about him, yet we can say with near certainty that he's a ~~walking~~ driving hypocrite. Yet the fragile ego blinds us all to our own hypocrisy as we all just LOVE trying to convince ourselves how we're ""better"" than others, as if that's the only way we know how to be ""happy."" (See: the entire internet)

But there are deeper ideas about car culture/history to be explored. Stop signs and lights were not prevalent when there were only bikes, before the popularization of cars. There's a reason why there's this prevailing idea that cars and bikes should be subject to the exact same road rules. I suspect it was/is the car companies putting huge efforts into lobbying and marketing/propaganda for rules and infrastructure to purposely discourage cycling in order to increase their own sales, and our thought patterns today are still reflective of that."
75,"I‚Äôve a friend who used to drink Black Russian and would have to order the component parts and mix it himself. This was at university and outside London, but due to the strength of the drink he was told. It was also an age ago.

76,"What kind of classes are you looking for ?
Most schools have day classes (usually 3 times a week for about 3 months) and evening classes (1 or 2 times a week for 5 months)
For day classes many schools will have a new session starting in November. For evening classes, you'll have to wait until end of January /beginning of February.
I'd recommand CPAB, nice teachers and groups are not too big. It's about 250‚Ç¨ for +/- 100 hours."

85,Thanks for all the nice comments guys. I don't really feel traumatised by the whole event (yet)... probably because his wife who was a doctor managed to keep it all really professional- she was doing mouth to mouth and giving me instructions with CPR until paramedics arrived. That meant I was somewhat mentally separated from the whole event as it happened. In truth it just all happened really quickly and I left as soon as the paramedics arrived. The real difficulty for me was seeing his wife right after the paramedics took over and asked her to step aside. Just seeing how devastated she was once she was powerless to help really hit me at that point.
86,Just watched the CBC report (CBC news channel) on this and they didn't mention Airbnb once.   They kept referring to it as a hotel but then they interviewed a lady who lived across the street and she referred to it as a hostel.

* Wei Chen, in the patio segment, hosted CBC Ontario Morning for most of the province for 15 years.
* Cityline's Tracy Moore does the segment on paramedic dangers.
* Marcia McMillan of The Weather Network and now CTV Morning News is the health reporter.
* The entertainment reporter is Dina Pugliese, of Breakfast Television.

123,"It‚Äôs changed 78% since I first started coming up here in the 2000s‚Ä¶ some examples:
- Kings Cross is quite chic and pricey 
- Shoreditch was quite cool for a bit in 2010s, now expensive but still creative 
- Camden has lost its couple of queer spaces, and has been burnt down and rebuilt twice since 1998
- Stratford 1998 vs 2024 is unrecognisable 
- we now have Tate Modern (with an extension!)

Places such as Marylebone, Hampstead, Portobello and Pimlico haven‚Äôt changed much. In all areas the high street has changed, there are more chicken shops, nail bars and betting shops; more restaurants and food places, less pubs. In central there are hideous candy stores and souvenir shops taking over‚Ä¶. And on every street there‚Äôs tons of empty shops :(

Travel is expensive, the Elizabeth line is great though. The central line, Piccadilly line, jubilee line, bakerloo line and Hammersmith and city lines probably haven‚Äôt changed much at all! We have new routemaster buses that have odd seating and no air con in the summer ü´†

2) Embrace remote work. It's the future and inevitable.  Canada is uniquely positioned to stimulate growth in non-metropolitan communities while reducing traffic in the GTA by eliminating the need to commute.

3) Focus on building safe and efficient transit systems that people want to take instead of commuting.

- The property must be used or intended in whole or in part for residential purposes (in the case of building land, the allowance is ‚Ç¨100,000 and the ceiling is ‚Ç¨300,000).
- The entire property must be acquired on a freehold basis (not part of a building, usufruct or bare ownership).
- It is forbidden to own, at the date of the preliminary sales agreement, the entire freehold of another property intended, in whole or in part, for residential use, whether in Belgium or abroad.
- The property must be used as a main residence within three years of registration of the purchase. - Those who also wish to carry out energy renovations - and thus improve the energy performance of their home - will be granted an additional period. In this case, the period is extended to 5 years.
- You must maintain your main residence in the property for a continuous period of five years (this period starts to run from the date of entry in the population register or the register of foreign nationals).

I personally think it's a great time to have newly coming into adulthood people learn more skills and more responsibility with less consequences than in university and basically figure their shit out. 

This kid not wanting to go to cegep is missing out on the advantages and freedoms allotted a year early vs grade 12.

Ymmv but it was a great thing for me at a pivotal age and I think many had the same experience.

Also, in CEGEP your grades are accessed online. (At least when I was there, many, many years ago.)
I chose to share them with my parents but it's not sent to them automatically, hence the much more freedom to succeed/fail and set you up for university. They don't want to talk to parents at all. They want you to advocate for yourself and guide yourself, but with much more support if needed in terms of academics if seeked out.

Also, if your sister feels the need to be pretentious but attend a cegep go for marianopolis. To be honest, her grades will be what gets her where she wants, regardless of her school at cegep level but if she needs the pretentious private school vibe, go there.

Cegep is a time to figure one's self out and yes, also if you're driven acquire the grades necessary to enter the possibly competitive programs you seek but it's basically a numbers game."

192,"Whan this happened to me I phoned the local hospital the next day and I got a very guarded ""she's alive"". No further information and I'm not sure I wanted any. I'm guessing St Thomas's is the nearest one to Embankment.     

Well done for performing CPR. I've done it once and I think that if I've done nothing else I've made the world a better place. Do take the advice of finding someone to talk to, I didn't and still find is a bit triggering, if only that I complain when it's not being done right on the TV."

The number one focus should be improving public transit somehow in the interim. We all know it takes 25+ years to build anything transit-related around here.

Maybe that means express buses to subway stations/go stations. Express subway trains. 

Subsidize the absolute shit out of transit of all sorts so it‚Äôs easier to get around. I get that VIA is a federal jurisdiction, but do something so commuters have the option of taking that train into union station (or wherever) for a reduced cost.

211,Generally this year was ok. I always lament the days of when it was a huge city event. Spanning the entire downtown core and even further into different neighborhoods. It was funded by Scotiabank those days and they had lots of thoughtful and engaging work from all over the world. While a lot of of the work this year came from all over it all felt pretty low budget and kinda tacky. Nothing ‚Äúwowed‚Äù me like before and it was really quite mild weather I‚Äôm surprised that it didn‚Äôt feel very busy in the city.

In Uccle between Saint-Job and Calevoet you have a place called Kauwberg. 
Just walking around there is great you don't feel you're still inside Brussels. There are some horses, donkeys or at least it used to. 
Right beside that place you have a small park called ""la sauvag√®re"" which is a small cute park with some farm animals hanging out in their enclosures. 

If you like craft beers near Albert you have a pub called ""Le Dynamo"" they have at least 15 craft beers on tap and many more in their fridges. They show a lot of sports games on a big screen, they have a SNES with some games and some evenings when the owner is there you can gamble a free drink if you beat him at Mario Kart.

219,"Problem lies with the justice department. Police does arrest them but first they have to commit 5-10 crimes before justice even thinks about putting them somewhere.

221,"As much as I‚Äôd love for the Gardner and 401 to be underground (specifically the Gardner) I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a good idea there should be other options. A project like that will take 20+ years knowing how Toronto operates, it will completely backlog the city, cost a ridiculous amount of money, increase reliance on cars, and what happens when repairs are needed? If people think the garner is an inconvenience being repaired now, imagine how expensive, distributive, and time consuming it would be to make these repairs underground in a tunnel. The only thing worse then being in gridlock for hours is being in gridlock for hours underground. 

The money that would be spent on projects like this could be spent on improving the TTC as well as the GO, having a proper and effective public transportation system spanning to all areas of the GTA would alleviate a lot more of the congestion in the GTA then putting more highways in a tunnel would."

231,"Does she know that if she doesn't go to CEGEP, her university degree will be four years instead of the usual three?

She can either finish secondary school up to grade 11, then spend two years in CEGEP followed by three years at university, or she can finish grade 12 and go directly to university for four years. Both options take the same amount of time, but the second option will cost her much more since two years in CEGEP are less expensive than one semester at university.

However, I would assume that instead of doing an extra year of high school plus a year of general education courses at university‚Äîmeaning spending time on subjects she may not be interested in‚Äîshe would likely find it more enjoyable to spend two years in CEGEP focusing on something she specifically likes, whether it's science and math or humanities."

The fines for not doing your due dilligence are huge so the agent is trying to cover his back in case anything bad should happen in the future. Let‚Äôs say you are not who you say you are and turn the property into a brothel or drug den ( extreme, I know, but it happened ), then the landlord can take the agents to court. Having everything documented shows that they have done their due dilligence and would not be liable for anything.
Also, providing your passport copy, right to rent, bank statements or utility bills showing your address are legal requirements for anti money laundering checks.

Oh, and if someone asks for money, just reply with a ''Non, d√©sol√©'' and go on your way.  Pretending you didn't hear them or act like they don't exist is a sure way to trigger some of them.  Don't make prolonged eye contact or argue back to their nonsense, as they have nothing better to do than getting into arguments for no reason.

258,">After more than 30 years, Toronto police say they are now close to solving the murder of an East York arcade owner who was brutally beaten to death with a baseball bat on Christmas Eve, 1988.

>Police previously said 50-year-old Nick Gournis was working late at the arcade he owned and operated on Kingston Road, near Victoria Park Avenue, when two robbers entered the business and attacked him.

>‚ÄúWe believe that between about 10 p.m. and midnight that two people had actually entered his premises and proceeded to try to rob him and unfortunately, it looks like they resorted to extreme violence in order to exact their toll,‚Äù Det. Sgt. Steve Smith told CP24.com on Wednesday.

>Smith said Gournis was simply trying to make money to support his wife and two children when his life was tragically cut short."
259,"I used to live in Ixelles Chatelain area, that‚Äôs when I got my parking permit. I went to talk to them in person and the guy told me I could park everywhere in Ixelles besides the red areas.

A bit later I moved, still in Ixelles but in Matonge, so I didn‚Äôt hurry with the address change since I was still in the same commune. Long story short got 16 fines because Ixelles is split into sectors that I didn‚Äôt know about and they didn‚Äôt wanna cancel them. I tried explaining that their colleague messed up and even had the map. Told me that there‚Äôs no proof I didn‚Äôt circle it myself.

All the options provided a comparable amount of benefit for the amount of money spent. That's why there were three different options. This option is cheapest because it allows them to have a good chunk of the route at-grade and not in an expensive tunnel.

This option was one of three put forward by the Liberal government. Not everything is a massive conspiracy."

That said I'm not worried, if you think the city can fonction without cars your really have no idea how our world works. You do realise most of the thing you use are not build locally, it has to be brought in, maintain and disposed of and all that needs to be done by car.

292,"Brussels has quite an excellent cinema scene, with a lot of variety. 

My favourites are:

- Palace (nice place to also just hang out). With their 6-ticket deal, it's only 6,5 euro per screening. 

- Galeries. They have a similar deal, if you buy 5 tickets at once it's only 6 euro per screening. 

- Cinematek. They often do a certain theme, recently showing all the Jeanne Dealman movies. Very odd, if not impossible to see otherwise.

300,"People who argue Rogers is decent because they spend money are missing something. It's not about how much money you throw around, but what you spend the money on. Lots of terrible sports franchises have rich owners who DO spend. The problem is they consistently hire the worse management, or their ego gets in the way and they meddle/and or only hire sycophants. Masai for example isn't a guy who's going to kiss up to someone higher up, he's going to tell them what he needs and what he needs out of them. Guys like Ed Rogers or James Dolan don't like that. So they consistently hire wimps who either can't or won't make an unpopular move to improve their organization and so just maintain the status quo. The Jays outside of the AA years were very much like that.

And to hire the best people, you need people skills to attract the best people. They're not going to come here if you just want them to be yes men."

If they were scared and greedy, they would make a virtual copy and sell it for a big price.

They don't even live in it, and it is highly secured. It's like they just want it to rot and deprive the whole humanity from seeing it for no other reason than hating people ?

Seeing that they play with the law to earn public money while depriving taxpayers to see what they pay for makes me think they are just scum but maybe there is something else."

But from a city level, shouldn‚Äôt officials be ashamed of what‚Äôs going on down there. Drug zombies roaming the streets, screaming at random people, drinking and doing drugs openly and harassing, sometimes physical regular tax paying citizens.

Coming back from China and Japan where this activity is non existent, downtown MTL is literally turning into a piss and shithole that‚Äôs only going to get worse because no one at any level of government knows how to solve it.

Go down a couple blocks you‚Äôll see a full damn tent encampment at square viger where not only have taken over the entire park, it‚Äôs a Mecca for drug dealing, theft etc. Anything done about it. Nope.

on a separate note what consistutes a deep cleaning is not what I would classify as a deep clean. I learnt this the hard way as a newbie to the UK. A deep clean is no better than a normal clean.

319,"Hello! A few paragraphs from the article:

Financial services firms, the federal government and other employers are increasingly taking a harder line on remote work, with more mandating their staff to come into the office a minimum number of days a week and others threatening to discipline or terminate employees if they refuse to do so.

Starting this month, the federal government is requiring employees to be in the¬†[office](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-ottawa-embraces-luddite-thinking-in-forcing-civil-servants-back-to-the/)¬†three times a week, up from twice a week previously. In the private sector, insurer Canada Life has increased the number of required in-person days to three from two starting this month, while Telus Corp. has told its call-centre staff that they have to work in person three times a week or can opt to¬†leave¬†with severance pay.

Employers are insisting on more in-person work to help foster more collaboration and ensure new employees have an opportunity to learn on the job. The federal government also cited collaboration for its new requirements, saying it will help get new talent up to speed as well as build a ‚Äúculture of performance that is consistent with values and ethics of the public service,‚Äù according to the Treasury Board Secretariat‚Äôs website.

Economic participation implies working either as an employee OR as a civil servant. The law never restricts this to the Belgian civil service. Some clever prosecutor tried to argue in the past that the EU commission was not a civil service and they were obviously laughed out of court.

The same reasoning could apply to international civil servants but it's hard to know without having access to the specifics of your situation (which organization, which status do you have, what kind of contract, what does the accord de si√®ge say, ...).

But you don't have anything to lose : you can always apply with the documents you have, i.e. ask HR to provide you with a document detailing your work history + status as an international civil servant. If they deny you, you can always reapply later.

But check again with your lawyer (or another lawyer, go to the well-known immigration law firms, i.e. those whose lawyers train other lawyers)."

348,"Hey,

I saw you're at the VUB. Nobody cares if you miss the first week, it can happen to everybody.

Belgians are quite difficult to get to know if you're only here for a year, so you'll need to find other international students to be friends with. The VUB has a chapter of the Erasmus Students Network where you can meet lots of people.

If you're fixed on wanting to find Belgian friends, I'd suggest joining the a student society. Lots of them are Dutch-speaking, but the one called SWAMP also welcomes English-speakers. They're a club with a focus on board games and RPG's like Dungeons & Dragons.

Good luck!"

362,"My neighbour feeds the foxes.

Well, they feed 'the birds' by putting food up on their shed roof. 

When we moved in, we found so many holes dug in our lawn, by the foxes, and we found that the shed, which the previous owner had left full of shit, was literally *full of shit*. Rat shit, specifically. 

So, our neighbour feeding 'the birds' had caused a rat infestation, and a fox problem.

The foxes are a massive nuisance. They stole one of my shoes that had dogshit on it, that I put out in the garden overnight so I could clean it the next day. The shoe was a brand new one. I stepped in shit on my first outing. That cost me ¬£60 in lost shoes. They also ripped open a bag of compost my wife bought to pot her new plant that she bought to make our house feel like a home. They strew the compost all over the lawn, and pissed all over the bag. They then dug up the lawn where they'd strewn the compost because fox reasons. 

Worst of all, the foxes keep shitting on my lawn, and despite me cleaning it up whenever I see it, my dog likes to rub himself in any traces of it that gets left behind, so not only does he fucking stink, and I have to wash him much more often than he really should be washed (and he hates me every time I do it), but also the fox shit *GAVE MY DOG MANGE*. This has cost me over ¬£200 so far, and will continue to cost me about ¬£20 a month in perpetuity, to keep him on preventative medications. Not to mention that he was very sick for a couple of weeks whilst the meds got the fucking MANGE under control.

Foxes are cute. Yes.

They're also a nuisance and a danger.

Stop feeding them. You're encouraging diseased vermin to live in your garden, and if you have kids or pets, beware of parasites that can make them seriously ill, that foxes carry."

Camp de base is great for its routesetting, but has tons of people because its close to ULB so gets chaotic/dirty. Arkose is quite good overall, not the greatest routesetting but solid and spacious. A Bloc is good overall, lots of space but the routes can be on the hard side. Petite Ile is by far the worst. Old holds, bad routesetting, too many kids running around (might've changed since I stopped going). The only saving grace they have is their cosy cafe-area. But from everyone I know who frequents all of these gyms, most of people's injuries come from there ... and that says a lot about the routesetting which is easily the most important aspect of climbing for me."

378,"This is very similar to an incident way back. I was commuting into Charing Cross. At London Bridge the train doors opened and a young woman there just literally fainted and fell out, feet half in the door. I have some fairly old medical training, enough to know that her head hitting the platform was not good. She was unresponsive, but breathing. I called the platform guard over. He was about as much use as a chocolate fire guard. His only concern was getting her legs out of the door so the train could move. I really thought this was a bad idea, but he was adamant. She had to be moved. 

Some other passengers helped me move her to the waiting room. Conveniently she fainted right next to it. By this time I had called an ambulance, which arrived very quickly, Guys being right next door. Paramedics arrived, and because I had called, they wanted me to go with her to A&E. I had no idea who she was, just another commuter. But I did go along. 

Guys A&E were fantastic. The diagnosis was low blood pressure and very low blood sugar. They got her awake and I was able to talk to her. She got me to call her boyfriend, whilst guys gave the ultimate recovery drug - a slice of buttered toast! 

It turned out that this was to be her first day in a new job and she was very nervous. No food, no liquid of any type that morning. Anyway, the boyfriend turned up, and wanted to know why I, a total stranger, was with his girlfriend in a hospital A&E ward. After some confusion and embarrassment he eventually found out that I was just the Good Samaritan. 

But I was very cross with the guard. Head injury is no joke, and the right thing to do would have been to leave her to professionals."

382,"Too much of the Thames side is private sadly. Should've been made law 50 years ago that anything built next to the Thames or other London rivers must leave a 4 meter space for a wide path. Lots of big new developments do leave a nice path tbf but it's mostly pointless unless all developments do the same so the path is continuous.

Sadly councils still approve a few places right up to the edge of rivers, Tower Hamlets and the LLDC(London Legacy Development Corporation) are bad with it.

Tbh as mayor I'd just say screw it and find areas with long stretches of Thames side path interupted by a short private/blocked off bit and just stick a basic pontoon/floating walkway on the Thames going around the blocked off area. Might not work for the super long blocked off bits like the stretch OP mentions but theres plenty of bits blocked by a very short private section. Those bits you could build a very basic path going around it and make the Thames path uninterupted again. Look at the Isle of Dogs for examples, 90% might be fine and we currently have a super long nice thames path around the whole thing but the final 10% ruins it. Build a path around the final 10% of sections unless the land owners agree to open up their private river front section. Offer them like 1/4 the cost of what the new pontoon/floating walkway would cost and if they reject then build the new walkway instead.

One driver recently told me if I didn‚Äôt want to be passed within one foot at excessive speeds I should ride on the sidewalk despite it being against the law for me to do so. I can‚Äôt help but feeling like you‚Äôre telling me my life doesn‚Äôt matter in that moment. 

Share the road people, drivers and cyclists alike."

389,"I remember coming back from high school. I must have been in grade 11 or 12. I turned on the TV to watch my usual shows. The last channel the TV was on was cp24 so that was the first thing I saw. For some reason, I thought it was just an accidental plane crash. It hadn't dawned on me the gravity of the situation. Next day at school, it was all everyone was talking about and for the next several weeks, it felt like the world had sunk into a mire of despair and uncertainty."
390,"We had a similar experience in our previous apartment. Our downstairs neighbour, an old lady, was constantly complaining to us that we ¬´¬†walk too loud¬†¬ª. We found this weird but didn‚Äôt want to upset her so we tried to be as quiet as possible. We ended up walking on our toes and being afraid of living in our own home, since with the slightest noise she was knocking on our door. The more we tried to adjust to what she was asking the more complaints she had (her last comment was that our toilet flush and shower were too loud). As much as I don‚Äôt like being unpleasant to other people, I think you should put some boundaries from the beginning and if she complains again, explain to her that you did nothing wrong and just ignore her comments if she continues. If you are renting, it may be helpful if you ask your landlord‚Äôs help (in our case he intervened and spoke to the lady which made things better for a while)."
391,"Yes, everything sounds like this is an attempt at scamming you. It's 1) weird that they contact you instead of you contacting them, 2) very cheap is a red flag: for that price, they would have tons of interested people, so they wouldn't have to email you, 3) the email address sounds like classic scam attempt, 4) the classic out of the country excuse, 5) a default lease in Belgium is 3 years and extended after that, not 5 years."

They're usually trying to get drugs. It's a miserable existence, but you kind of have to learn to screen them out or it just gets overwhelming"

395,"So our bus routes have been ruined so that our street space can be monetised? Well done, everyone.

And yes, I'm serious about the bus routes. Routes near me that used to go to the west end now no longer go to the west end. I used to have a way home from Soho/Leicester Square straight to the end of my road 24 hours a day, now I have to take two to three buses with up to 30 minutes wait each (turning a formerly 1 hour journey into an up-to 2.5 hour journey) or take a bus that drops me a whole 10 blocks away from home.

We also used to have the ends of two different bus routes terminating in my area so you could hop off one and onto the other to connect south and north London. Now, one of them has been made to stop a mile short of the other one starting, so a two bus journey has now needlessly been made a 3 bus journey.

What is going on at TfL??? Our infrastructure is slowly being ruined."

398,">*It took at least six weeks for Bill Blair, then-public safety minister, to sign an electronic and entry warrant to monitor former Ontario cabinet minister Michael Chan in the lead-up to the 2021 federal election, according to documents tabled at the foreign-interference inquiry.*

>*Sworn testimony made public Friday suggests that the delay was eight weeks or more.*

>*The public inquiry was looking into a report last year by The Globe and Mail that Mr. Blair took about four months to sign off on the surveillance of Mr. Chan, an influential Liberal Party powerbroker in the Greater Toronto Area.*

>*The lag led to operational frustration from Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers, since it normally takes 10 days to get ministerial sign off.*

>*A national-security source told The Globe then that the delay left little time for CSIS to get the final approval of a federal judge to plant bugs in Mr. Chan‚Äôs cars, home, office, computers and mobile phones before the 2021 campaign got under way.*

>*The Globe did not identify the source because they risked prosecution under the Security of Information Act.*

>*...*

>*Ms. Tessier said she did not recall whether CSIS informed the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office that the target of the warrant was Mr. Chan and she did not know whether Ms. Astravas had briefed the PMO.*

>*The national-security source said in The Globe report last year that some within the spy agency suspected the hesitancy was because of Mr. Chan‚Äôs role as a major organizer and fundraiser for the Liberal Party. Speculation within CSIS was that there was discussions at the ‚Äúpolitical level‚Äù about going after Mr. Chan, according to the source.*

>*Mr. Chan has for years been a national-security target of CSIS because of alleged links to China‚Äôs Toronto consulate and association with proxies of Beijing. The Globe reported in 2015 that Mr. Chan had been the subject of CSIS security briefings in Ontario. He was in the Ontario Liberal cabinets of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne from 2007 to 2018.*

>*...*

>*Mr. Vigneault told the Hogue inquiry during the summer that he was very surprised that a key report on China‚Äôs targeting of elected officials was never provided to Mr. Trudeau. ‚ÄúThis was a very illustrative piece of intelligence analysis that should have been read by the Prime Minister.‚Äù*

Came to London from a developing country, and my expectations about quality of housing and public transportations were high due to other experiences in other countries, but London quality on housing/infrastructure is abnormally bad.

I don‚Äôt regret paying a bit more for a good place, as I still like to live here, would recommend the same if you can.

Anyway, the sentiment about wanting to go home and how scammy London feels is very valid. I felt exactly the same when I arrived here. I promise this will pass, it won‚Äôt ever be like you want, but there are other things that will make up for it: easy travel to Europe, variety of events in London, historical sites, etc.

I initially ignored and walked by the TVs and went to the library to check emails and browse the morning sports websites like the  slacker goof I was (this was when there was a lot of anticipation going into the Raptors 2001-2002 season after re-signing Vince and ""the core""). It was only when news of what was really happening started spreading online that I truly grasped what was happening.

Strangely, despite the commuter chaos in the pics here, I don't remember having any problems commuting home by TTC and later GO Train.

I managed to pass the French exam but at the time there were stories in the news about people who had been working comfortably (mostly spoken, not written) in French for years but who could not pass the exam, mainly because their written French was not great. So I felt like my background of written grammar/ verb tenses, etc did actually help me pass that part. I don't know what the exam is like these days. There are some hospitals with official bilingual status, but it's not super clear which hospitals those are, and you still need to be able to work in French with francophone patients, family members and colleagues. I have heard of staff being reprimanded for charting in English but I'm not sure what the actual rules are. I've also heard complaints about people sending work emails in English.

They did let us know that it could take up to 48 hours so I guess maybe that's why this person did the bag AND box??

As in maybe the refugee status is too widely applied, or maybe this company is taking ridiculous risks (although I can only presume they see a market for these kind of trips and don't expect the majority of their busses being blown up by Russians). Not getting into how good or bad the FlixBus service is, have never taken it and do not plan upon it but it seems to be okay for the majority of people that take it. They're a discount service so they're not going to open new destinations for charity, they think there's a market for these kind of trips and I doubt it's just for wounded soldiers returning to the front."

I say this not to brag, but because I sometimes see friends or acquaintances feeling like they are less than for not being able to afford to buy in their 30s in Brussels, when others are already owners. Others (aka me) are privileged and lucky, I won't call my case generational wealth because both my parents are from humble backgrounds, but if they hadn't squirreled every penny away like they did, I'd still be renting 70sqm for 1100/1200‚Ç¨."

I do think it‚Äôs unfair if they are asking you all the money upfront if you still intend to do the sessions (and at least from the clauses of the contract you posted, there seems to be no basis for it).

465,"Here are some excerpts from The Kyiv Independent's interview with people who'd seen the film:
____________________

Anna Hints, Estonian, film director

There's nothing inherently wrong with portraying a different side to the story, but as a filmmaker, it's essential to put things into context.

Trofimova uses narration as a cinematic tool and by analyzing it we get a very clear directorial standpoint. While stepping onto the soil of the land where she is going to film, we hear her say that this is either eastern Ukraine, part of the new Russian territories, or the so-called Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic, depending on the point of view. With this kind of narrative, she establishes her stance: for the director, there is a ‚Äúfog of war‚Äù and ambiguity, where she avoids clearly stating that this is Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia since 2014. Trofimova's film also conveniently avoids any anti-Putin statements.

Peace and empathy are very important, but when they are preached together with violating the right for existence for a free Ukraine, it becomes highly problematic. The film shows the pointlessness of war without acknowledging the truth of the Russian invasion and the Russian military‚Äôs war crimes. So it‚Äôs just empathy for the soldiers without any critical context.

____________________



Anna Malgina, Russian, film critic

According to Trofimova, her film is anti-war, but it is unclear what the author has in mind ‚Äì the war is presented in the film as a kind of natural disaster. It is unclear from the film who started this war, and where the soldiers are shooting. Considering that the director did not see any war crimes (according to her statement at the press conference), the soldiers are apparently shooting into the stratosphere, and the main occupation of these ‚Äúpoor things‚Äù on the occupied territories is bringing humanitarian aid to pensioners and caring for homeless animals.

We see how soldiers fall in love, doubt the purpose of their presence at war, and mourn the dead soldiers. The fact that almost all the characters of the film went to kill voluntarily for big money is not reflected by the author. Also, the film does not criticize the current regime or the president. And Putin's face appears for a couple of seconds closer to the end of the film in passing on TV without any author's commentary.

Any commentary from the author, who claims that she spent seven months at the front without permission from the Defense Ministry, does not inspire confidence."
466,"About a year ago, some drunk guy started touching/bothering a girl (who was a minor) in the bus I was in. People started yelling and another passenger got involved and started a fist fight with the drunk person.

So it's for that type of cases."

 Honestly nothing can help with the burning feeling of humiliation and self hatred that comes with it. You keep going ""How could I be so fucking dense it was so obvious"", but we are human and social interactions aren't easy, if some rushes us and presses us we try to be nice and our rationality goes on the back seat. 
 
 It's unfortunate, but the only thing is that as soon as someone becomes insistant and you get that feeling ""That's weird"", it means something's fishy. In that case it's always best to try to delay whatever they're asking for and see the reaction that happens, they'll usually be the ones falling into their own trap and making mistakes from feeling rushed. 
 
  If it makes you feel anything better, when I went to the police to note my scam, there were old folks that got scammed for thousands and thousands of euros and definitely not in a situation where they could spend them, and some indian scammers with fake numbers took it all...

516,"I always found it pretty funny that Brussels stumbled its way into becoming the de facto EU capital because [Belgium starts with the letter ""B""](https://www.brusselstimes.com/29273/why-did-brussels-become-the-capital-of-europe-because-belgium-starts-with-letter-b).

>Why then did Brussels end up emerging nonetheless? Because Belgium starts with letter B. Here is the story.

>In March 1957, the treaty that creates the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Community for Atomic Energy (Euratom) is signed in Rome. Several cities are candidates for hosting them, including Brussels with a proposal for the Heyzel site. But no consensus can be reached, and on 1 January 1958, when the new institutions are supposed to start operating, no decision has yet been taken. The first fonctionnaires have been hired, but they don‚Äôt know in which country their offices will be.

>An emergency meeting takes place in Paris on 6 January but does not manage to overcome the stalemate. Who is in charge of finding a provisional solution? It had been decided that the new institutions would be chaired in turn by the ministers of each of the six member states.

>Which country first? The first one in alphabetical order: Belgium. A few months earlier, Victor Larock had taken over as Belgium‚Äôs foreign minister from Paul-Henri Spaak, the mastermind of the Treaty of Rome who had become NATO‚Äôs second secretary general in May 1957. He was the man in the uncomfortable driving seat.  

>In February 1958, on behalf of the Belgian government, he decides to rent from the insurance company Royale belge (now AXA) an office building in construction on Avenue de la Joyeuse Entr√©e, next to the Parc du Cinquantenaire, on a location now covered by the seat European External Action Services.

>By the time the presidency moves on from Belgi√´/Belgique to Deutschland, in the second semester of 1958, the consensus is no greater on the choice of the seat. Moreover, in December 1958, Charles de Gaulle becomes President of the French Republic, and it seems as obvious to him that the seat of the European institutions should be located in what is by far the biggest city of the ‚Äúpetite Europe‚Äù, i.e. Paris, as it is obvious to the others that this would be most unwise.

>The Belgian government quickly realizes that the uncertainty may last long and that far more office space will be needed. In December 1958, it expresses its interest in acquiring the convent and school of the nuns of Berlaymont, located on the rue de la Loi between the rue Archim√®de and the boulevard Charlemagne: thanks to the big garden, there would be no need to destroy too many houses in order to make room for a huge office building, that could conceivably be turned into a ministry if European institutions decided to move elsewhere. In exchange, the government offers the nuns the state domain of Argenteuil (in the commune of Waterloo).

2. Poor driving skills and behaviour of people, you have no idea how much this is impacting traffic in Brussels 

3. Poor road design, which were already present prior to goodmove

4. A simple increase of people commuting with cars or driving around in Brussels with a car

A lot of the causes for huge traffic in Brussels are simply caused by a handful of problematic intersections whose backlog are in turn causing other traffic issues

584,"Yeah I go to EPFC and it's very good and I think well renowned. Go on their website and have a look, although you won't be able to sign up just yet. It will give you a date that booking appointments opens, book one at that time and you can be enrolled for the next course.

I waited about a month and 4 hrs X 3 days a week for 90 euros."
585,"Uccle.

I'm 99% sure I'm going to vote LB (MR+VLD+D√©fi). 

Some of their projects this past cycle have been great. Lots of participative democracy and citizen's workshops at the commune. 

*Really* good administration too. I go there ... surprisingly often, and every single time I go, it's very efficient. I'm usually in-and-out in about 10 mins.

Public hygiene here is great. Like, I have *no* complaints about it. They want to be even stricter when it comes to illegal dumping and, if I read the programme right, empower agents de quartier to issue fines on the spot to people who get caught dumping.

Uccle's homegrown mobility plan calls for a metro station at H√©ros. I live about 2 mins away, and no, we definitely do not need a metro station. 

Tram 4 works just fine and dandy to get downtown quickly. Tram 18 is also a nice alternative via Altitude 100 to hop up to Albert. 

I'm all for more public transportation, though - if they wanted extend Bus 74 one stop further to H√©ros (after Aulne/Elzeboom), that might be a nice idea to get people from H√©ros directly to Uccle-Stalle station."
586,"She‚Äôs lulling you into a false sense of security. It‚Äôs in her interests to fix issues. It‚Äôs in their interests to replace fault white goods. It benefits the property for you to dry your clothes in a tumble dryer instead of in the house. 

You realise that just one month of rent could probably cover several replacement washers, cover their mortgage and still have money left to spare?

Come back to us after you‚Äôve moved, and she hasn‚Äôt raised rent, tried to sell up, or tried to rob you of your deposit in some way. Then I‚Äôll maybe believe it. 

All you‚Äôve described is just very basic level of the minimum that should be required. There‚Äôs nothing particularly good about what‚Äôve you described. The bar is just ridiculously low.

Wasn‚Äôt that long ago I came across a post from a guy who thought his landlord was great, he fixed things quickly, was always very affable. Then the poster moved out, the landlord trashed the flat with repair works after the poster had paid for a professional clean, and tried to retain the deposit. They‚Äôre all nice until they aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs easy to be nice, it‚Äôs less easy to be a fundamentally good, moral person.

There‚Äôs nothing moral or good about being a landlord."
587,"As a person with severe mobility issues, YES. Car free Sunday is the best. If I need to go to the hospital, I‚Äôm not stuck in 3 hours of traffic. If I want to go to the shop for essentials, I can walk on the road and not trip and fall 15 times on the cobbles! 

A city made for people? More of that please üôè"
588,"Yeah because nobody has kids that they need to drag around with heavy backpacks, and because everybody lives 10 min from work by foot, and because everybody has the physical capacity to drag groceries around (and I mean groseries for a family of 2+ people or even +1) üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ

Ah yets, and because everybody has the money to take ubers and taxis ‚Ä¶.

589,"I have to move around 6 boxes from canary wharf to stratford. Unfortunately the rents don't overlap, i was thinking of putting the boxes in a storage and then have a moving company to move it there.


Does anyone have a recommended company or another suggestion to do the move?"

591,"I used to have one of these garbage people in my Pickering high school. I guess they grow up but don‚Äôt wise up. 

Sorry you had this experience. I was just in Ottawa and had a shouting street person get in my space. The only thing to do was dial up the voice to maximum and fight fire with fire. Disrupt.

I would gladly do that to distract a hater from anyone being harassed. The benefits of being six foot two, used for good."
592,"> √Ä travers l'immense historique de mod√©ration, nous avons rapidement remarqu√© qu'il y avait bel et bien une approche moins-qu'exemplaire dans le pass√© - beaucoup de sources de frustrations et de d√©cisions de mod√©ration occasionnellement douteuses...


Apr√®s le d√©part des deux principaux mod√©rateurs (/u/c0ldfusi0n et /u/gotnoob) on a vu un d√©clin de qualit√© immense et juste du spam, idiots tourists ou des morons qui savent pas utiliser Google.

Il avait des threads sur les sujets importants, le thread du d√©m√©nagement pis le freedom Friday thread. On a plus √ßa maintenant.

Je vois mal comment des nouveaux mods peuvent arriver √† la cheville de ces deux-l√†. √áa fait 10 ans que je perds mon temps ici pis c‚Äôest un des seuls subreddit que je pouvais tol√©rer.

Pis apr√®s tu as un des mods (s√ªrement /u/dlord) qui a mit le flair ""absolute idiot"" a /u/gabmori7, un ancien mod qui √©tait appr√©ci√© et qui faisait des tours guid√©s pendant les f√™tes.

C‚Äôest peut √™tre √ßa que tu parles de d√©cisions douteuses.

Mais bon, bonne chance."
593,"The force described the suspect as a tall and slim black male wearing dark clothing and riding an e-scooter.

It added the male's face was obscured ""possibly by a mask or balaclava"", and he rode the e-scooter to and from the scene.



Oh god, this stereotype of a young man riding an e-scooter and wearing a balaclava most likely going to commit a crime is true."
594,"They're definitely unexperienced, I assume they're either young or a wannabe roadman. Normally they'd confront you with something. I'd say report it just so people can be more wary of their surroundings in that specific place, but otherwise I really doubt they're in any sort of gang. Gang members don't do this stuff, at least not like this guy."
595,"I used to get my hair cut at Salon Toc on St. Laurent Blvd in Chinatown. It is super efficient and very cheap, they seem to have mostly male clients - I think if you show them a picture or tell them the style they'll be able to do it! I think a cut costs $15- it was $10 some years ago and cash only, not sure if that's still the case!"

598,"https://www.issflowthrough.co.uk/river-lea-clapton-london/

The bubble barrier was installed at an angle across the River Lea navigation. This ensures that any debris coming up to the barrier would be directed down towards a litter collection point. This collection point was created by the channel wall and an existing bridge buttress, by downstream flow."
599,"I actually support building more roads, but not continuously widen 401. (In parallel we should continue invest into transit so there‚Äôs alternative and options to travel.)

Cars are not going away anytime soon and no one has a good viable transit solution for the burbs yet. 

The city has zero expressway getting people off from DVP/Gardiner to places they want. The reason why 401/DVP/Gardiner are a cluster fuck is because that‚Äôs the only way you can get around Toronto. When theres a rush, everyone is bottlenecked by Spadina/Bloor/Eglington. 

This is not limited to Toronto itself. Markham and few other sprawling towns has no expressway as well so you are SOL stuck on one of the original farm roads for 20 mins just going 60/70kph from 404 to east Markham."
