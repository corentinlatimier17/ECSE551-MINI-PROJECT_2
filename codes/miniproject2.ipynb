This implementation will provide a deeper understanding of how the Bernoulli Naïve Bayes method works and how it can be applied to text classification.\n",

    "2. **Utilize a Classifier from Scikit-Learn**  \n",
    "   In the second part, a pre-built classifier from the `scikit-learn` library will be used to perform the same task. This comparison will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of our custom implementation against a widely used, optimized machine learning library.\n"
