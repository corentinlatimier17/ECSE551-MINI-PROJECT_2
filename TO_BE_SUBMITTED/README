# Subreddit Prediction Project

This project implements various machine learning models to classify text data from a subreddit prediction dataset. The models were developed and evaluated using different feature extraction techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation strategies.

## Overview of Models

The project consists of seven models, implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook focuses on specific models and methods for subreddit prediction:

1. **Models 1 and 2**:  
   Implemented in `models1_2_BernoulliNaiveBayes.ipynb`, these models are based on **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** classification with different feature extraction techniques and configurations.

2. **Model 3**:  
   Provided in `model3_SVM.ipynb`, this notebook implements a **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** classifier, using hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation.

3. **Model 4**:  
   Available in `model4_stacking.ipynb`, this notebook showcases a **stacking ensemble model** that combines predictions from multiple base models to improve overall performance.

4. **Models 5, 6, and 7**:  
   Implemented in `Mini Project 2_MNB, LR, CB.ipynb`, these models include:
   - **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (MNB)
   - **Logistic Regression** (LR)
   - **CatBoost** (CB) classifier
